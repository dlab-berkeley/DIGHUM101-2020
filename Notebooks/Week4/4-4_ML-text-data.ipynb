Words that are frequent, but are also used in every single document, will not be distinguishing. We want to identify words that are unevenly distributed across the corpus using TFIDF. By offsetting the frequency of a word by its document frequency (the number of documents in which it appears) will in theory filter out common terms such as 'the', 'of', and 'and'.\n",
