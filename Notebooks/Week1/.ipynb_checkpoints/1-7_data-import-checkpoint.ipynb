      "\n",
      "\n",
      "You will rejoice to hear that no disaster has accompanied the\n",
      "commencement of an enterprise which you have regarded with such evil\n",
      "forebodings.  I arrived here yesterday, and my first task is to assure\n",
      "my dear sister of my welfare and increasing confidence in the success\n",
      "of my undertaking.\n",
      "\n",
      "I am already far north of London, and as I walk in the streets of\n",
      "Petersburgh, I feel a cold northern breeze play upon my cheeks, which\n",
      "braces my nerves and fills me with delight.  Do you understand this\n",
      "feeling?  This breeze, which has travelled from the regions towards\n",
      "which I am advancing, gives me a foretaste of those icy climes.\n",
      "Inspirited by this wind of promise, my daydreams become more fervent\n",
      "and vivid.  I try in vain to be persuaded that the pole is the seat of\n",
      "frost and desolation; it ever presents itself to my imagination as the\n",
      "region of beauty and delight.  There, Margaret, the sun is for ever\n",
      "visible, its broad disk just skirting the horizon and diffusing a\n",
      "perpetual splendour.  There—for with your leave, my sister, I will put\n",
      "some trust in preceding navigators—there snow and frost are banished;\n",
      "and, sailing over a calm sea, we may be wafted to a land surpassing in\n",
      "wonders and in beauty every region hitherto discovered on the habitable\n",
      "globe.  Its productions and features may be without example, as the\n",
      "phenomena of the heavenly bodies undoubtedly are in those undiscovered\n",
      "solitudes.  What may not be expected in a country of eternal light?  I\n",
      "may there discover the wondrous power which attracts the needle and may\n",
      "regulate a thousand celestial observations that require only this\n",
      "voyage to render their seeming eccentricities consistent for ever.  I\n",
      "shall satiate my ardent curiosity with the sight of a part of the world\n",
      "never before visited, and may tread a land never before imprinted by\n",
      "the foot of man. These are my enticements, and they are sufficient to\n",
      "conquer all fear of danger or death and to induce me to commence this\n",
      "laborious voyage with the joy a child feels when he embarks in a little\n",
      "boat, with his holiday mates, on an expedition of discovery up his\n",
      "native river. But supposing all these conjectures to be false, you\n",
      "cannot contest the inestimable benefit which I shall confer on all\n",
      "mankind, to the last generation, by discovering a passage near the pole\n",
      "to those countries, to reach which at present so many months are\n",
      "requisite; or by ascertaining the secret of the magnet, which, if at\n",
      "all possible, can only be effected by an undertaking such as mine.\n",
      "\n",
      "These reflections have dispelled the agitation with which I began my\n",
      "letter, and I feel my heart glow with an enthusiasm which elevates me\n",
      "to heaven, for nothing contributes so much to tranquillise the mind as\n",
      "a steady purpose—a point on which the soul may fix its intellectual\n",
      "eye.  This expedition has been the favourite dream of my early years. I\n",
      "have read with ardour the accounts of the various voyages which have\n",
      "been made in the prospect of arriving at the North Pacific Ocean\n",
      "through the seas which surround the pole.  You may remember that a\n",
      "history of all the voyages made for purposes of discovery composed the\n",
      "whole of our good Uncle Thomas’ library.  My education was neglected,\n",
      "yet I was passionately fond of reading.  These volumes were my study\n",
      "day and night, and my familiarity with them increased that regret which\n",
      "I had felt, as a child, on learning that my father’s dying injunction\n",
      "had forbidden my uncle to allow me to embark in a seafaring life.\n",
      "\n",
      "These visions faded when I perused, for the first time, those poets\n",
      "whose effusions entranced my soul and lifted it to heaven.  I also\n",
      "became a poet and for one year lived in a paradise of my own creation;\n",
      "I imagined that I also might obtain a niche in the temple where the\n",
      "names of Homer and Shakespeare are consecrated.  You are well\n",
      "acquainted with my failure and how heavily I bore the disappointment.\n",
      "But just at that time I inherited the fortune of my cousin, and my\n",
      "thoughts were turned into the channel of their earlier bent.\n",
      "\n",
      "Six years have passed since I resolved on my present undertaking.  I\n",
      "can, even now, remember the hour from which I dedicated myself to this\n",
      "great enterprise.  I commenced by inuring my body to hardship.  I\n",
      "accompanied the whale-fishers on several expeditions to the North Sea;\n",
      "I voluntarily endured cold, famine, thirst, and want of sleep; I often\n",
      "worked harder than the common sailors during the day and devoted my\n",
      "nights to the study of mathematics, the theory of medicine, and those\n",
      "branches of physical science from which a naval adventurer might derive\n",
      "the greatest practical advantage.  Twice I actually hired myself as an\n",
      "under-mate in a Greenland whaler, and acquitted myself to admiration. I\n",
      "must own I felt a little proud when my captain offered me the second\n",
      "dignity in the vessel and entreated me to remain with the greatest\n",
      "earnestness, so valuable did he consider my services.\n",
      "\n",
      "And now, dear Margaret, do I not deserve to accomplish some great purpose?\n",
      "My life might have been passed in ease and luxury, but I preferred glory to\n",
      "every enticement that wealth placed in my path. Oh, that some encouraging\n",
      "voice would answer in the affirmative! My courage and my resolution is\n",
      "firm; but my hopes fluctuate, and my spirits are often depressed. I am\n",
      "about to proceed on a long and difficult voyage, the emergencies of which\n",
      "will demand all my fortitude: I am required not only to raise the spirits\n",
      "of others, but sometimes to sustain my own, when theirs are failing.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is the most favourable period for travelling in Russia.  They fly\n",
      "quickly over the snow in their sledges; the motion is pleasant, and, in\n",
      "my opinion, far more agreeable than that of an English stagecoach.  The\n",
      "cold is not excessive, if you are wrapped in furs—a dress which I have\n",
      "already adopted, for there is a great difference between walking the\n",
      "deck and remaining seated motionless for hours, when no exercise\n",
      "prevents the blood from actually freezing in your veins.  I have no\n",
      "ambition to lose my life on the post-road between St. Petersburgh and\n",
      "Archangel.\n",
      "\n",
      "I shall depart for the latter town in a fortnight or three weeks; and my\n",
      "intention is to hire a ship there, which can easily be done by paying the\n",
      "insurance for the owner, and to engage as many sailors as I think necessary\n",
      "among those who are accustomed to the whale-fishing. I do not intend to\n",
      "sail until the month of June; and when shall I return? Ah, dear sister, how\n",
      "can I answer this question? If I succeed, many, many months, perhaps years,\n",
      "will pass before you and I may meet. If I fail, you will see me again soon,\n",
      "or never.\n",
      "\n",
      "Farewell, my dear, excellent Margaret. Heaven shower down blessings on you,\n",
      "and save me, that I may again and again testify my gratitude for all your\n",

      "How slowly the time passes here, encompassed as I am by frost and snow!\n",
      "Yet a second step is taken towards my enterprise.  I have hired a\n",
      "vessel and am occupied in collecting my sailors; those whom I have\n",
      "already engaged appear to be men on whom I can depend and are certainly\n",
      "possessed of dauntless courage.\n",
      "\n",
      "But I have one want which I have never yet been able to satisfy, and the\n",
      "absence of the object of which I now feel as a most severe evil, I have no\n",
      "friend, Margaret: when I am glowing with the enthusiasm of success, there\n",
      "will be none to participate my joy; if I am assailed by disappointment, no\n",
      "one will endeavour to sustain me in dejection. I shall commit my thoughts\n",
      "to paper, it is true; but that is a poor medium for the communication of\n",
      "feeling. I desire the company of a man who could sympathise with me, whose\n",
      "eyes would reply to mine. You may deem me romantic, my dear sister, but I\n",
      "bitterly feel the want of a friend. I have no one near me, gentle yet\n",
      "courageous, possessed of a cultivated as well as of a capacious mind, whose\n",
      "tastes are like my own, to approve or amend my plans. How would such a\n",
      "friend repair the faults of your poor brother! I am too ardent in execution\n",
      "and too impatient of difficulties. But it is a still greater evil to me\n",
      "that I am self-educated: for the first fourteen years of my life I ran wild\n",
      "on a common and read nothing but our Uncle Thomas’ books of voyages.\n",
      "At that age I became acquainted with the celebrated poets of our own\n",
      "country; but it was only when it had ceased to be in my power to derive its\n",
      "most important benefits from such a conviction that I perceived the\n",
      "necessity of becoming acquainted with more languages than that of my native\n",
      "country. Now I am twenty-eight and am in reality more illiterate than many\n",
      "schoolboys of fifteen. It is true that I have thought more and that my\n",
      "daydreams are more extended and magnificent, but they want (as the painters\n",
      "call it) _keeping;_ and I greatly need a friend who would have sense\n",
      "enough not to despise me as romantic, and affection enough for me to\n",
      "endeavour to regulate my mind.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, these are useless complaints; I shall certainly find no friend on the\n",
      "wide ocean, nor even here in Archangel, among merchants and seamen. Yet\n",
      "some feelings, unallied to the dross of human nature, beat even in these\n",
      "rugged bosoms. My lieutenant, for instance, is a man of wonderful courage\n",
      "and enterprise; he is madly desirous of glory, or rather, to word my phrase\n",
      "more characteristically, of advancement in his profession. He is an\n",
      "Englishman, and in the midst of national and professional prejudices,\n",
      "unsoftened by cultivation, retains some of the noblest endowments of\n",
      "humanity. I first became acquainted with him on board a whale vessel;\n",
      "finding that he was unemployed in this city, I easily engaged him to assist\n",
      "in my enterprise.\n",
      "\n",
      "The master is a person of an excellent disposition and is remarkable in the\n",
      "ship for his gentleness and the mildness of his discipline. This\n",
      "circumstance, added to his well-known integrity and dauntless courage, made\n",
      "me very desirous to engage him. A youth passed in solitude, my best years\n",
      "spent under your gentle and feminine fosterage, has so refined the\n",
      "groundwork of my character that I cannot overcome an intense distaste to\n",
      "the usual brutality exercised on board ship: I have never believed it to be\n",
      "necessary, and when I heard of a mariner equally noted for his kindliness\n",
      "of heart and the respect and obedience paid to him by his crew, I felt\n",
      "myself peculiarly fortunate in being able to secure his services. I heard\n",
      "of him first in rather a romantic manner, from a lady who owes to him the\n",
      "happiness of her life. This, briefly, is his story. Some years ago he loved\n",
      "a young Russian lady of moderate fortune, and having amassed a considerable\n",
      "sum in prize-money, the father of the girl consented to the match. He saw\n",
      "his mistress once before the destined ceremony; but she was bathed in\n",
      "tears, and throwing herself at his feet, entreated him to spare her,\n",

      "and that her father would never consent to the union. My generous friend\n",

      "instantly abandoned his pursuit. He had already bought a farm with his\n",

      "wavering in my resolutions.  Those are as fixed as fate, and my voyage\n",
      "is only now delayed until the weather shall permit my embarkation.  The\n",
      "winter has been dreadfully severe, but the spring promises well, and it\n",
      "is considered as a remarkably early season, so that perhaps I may sail\n",

      "Last Monday (July 31st) we were nearly surrounded by ice, which closed\n",
      "in the ship on all sides, scarcely leaving her the sea-room in which\n",
      "she floated.  Our situation was somewhat dangerous, especially as we\n",
      "were compassed round by a very thick fog.  We accordingly lay to,\n",

      "\n",
      "About two o’clock the mist cleared away, and we beheld, stretched out\n",

      "have no end.  Some of my comrades groaned, and my own mind began to\n",
      "grow watchful with anxious thoughts, when a strange sight suddenly\n",
      "attracted our attention and diverted our solicitude from our own\n",
      "situation.  We perceived a low carriage, fixed on a sledge and drawn by\n",
      "dogs, pass on towards the north, at the distance of half a mile; a\n",
      "being which had the shape of a man, but apparently of gigantic stature,\n",
      "sat in the sledge and guided the dogs.  We watched the rapid progress\n",
      "of the traveller with our telescopes until he was lost among the\n",
      "distant inequalities of the ice.\n",
      "\n",
      "This appearance excited our unqualified wonder. We were, as we believed,\n",
      "many hundred miles from any land; but this apparition seemed to denote that\n",
      "it was not, in reality, so distant as we had supposed. Shut in, however, by\n",
      "ice, it was impossible to follow his track, which we had observed with the\n",
      "greatest attention.\n",
      "\n",
      "About two hours after this occurrence we heard the ground sea, and before\n",
      "night the ice broke and freed our ship. We, however, lay to until the\n",
      "morning, fearing to encounter in the dark those large loose masses which\n",
      "float about after the breaking up of the ice. I profited of this time to\n",
      "rest for a few hours.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the morning, however, as soon as it was light, I went upon deck and\n",
      "found all the sailors busy on one side of the vessel, apparently\n",
      "talking to someone in the sea.  It was, in fact, a sledge, like that we\n",
      "had seen before, which had drifted towards us in the night on a large\n",
      "fragment of ice.  Only one dog remained alive; but there was a human\n",
      "being within it whom the sailors were persuading to enter the vessel.\n",
      "He was not, as the other traveller seemed to be, a savage inhabitant of\n",
      "some undiscovered island, but a European.  When I appeared on deck the\n",
      "master said, “Here is our captain, and he will not allow you to perish\n",
      "on the open sea.”\n",
      "\n",
      "On perceiving me, the stranger addressed me in English, although with a\n",
      "foreign accent.  “Before I come on board your vessel,” said he,\n",
      "“will you have the kindness to inform me whither you are bound?”\n",
      "\n",
      "You may conceive my astonishment on hearing such a question addressed\n",
      "to me from a man on the brink of destruction and to whom I should have\n",
      "supposed that my vessel would have been a resource which he would not\n",
      "have exchanged for the most precious wealth the earth can afford.  I\n",
      "replied, however, that we were on a voyage of discovery towards the\n",
      "northern pole.\n",
      "\n",
      "Upon hearing this he appeared satisfied and consented to come on board.\n",
      "Good God!  Margaret, if you had seen the man who thus capitulated for\n",
      "his safety, your surprise would have been boundless.  His limbs were\n",
      "nearly frozen, and his body dreadfully emaciated by fatigue and\n",
      "suffering.  I never saw a man in so wretched a condition.  We attempted\n",
      "to carry him into the cabin, but as soon as he had quitted the fresh\n",
      "air he fainted.  We accordingly brought him back to the deck and\n",
      "restored him to animation by rubbing him with brandy and forcing him to\n",
      "swallow a small quantity.  As soon as he showed signs of life we\n",
      "wrapped him up in blankets and placed him near the chimney of the\n",
      "kitchen stove.  By slow degrees he recovered and ate a little soup,\n",
      "which restored him wonderfully.\n",
      "\n",
      "Two days passed in this manner before he was able to speak, and I often\n",
      "feared that his sufferings had deprived him of understanding.  When he\n",
      "had in some measure recovered, I removed him to my own cabin and\n",
      "attended on him as much as my duty would permit.  I never saw a more\n",
      "interesting creature:  his eyes have generally an expression of\n",
      "wildness, and even madness, but there are moments when, if anyone\n",
      "performs an act of kindness towards him or does him any the most\n",
      "trifling service, his whole countenance is lighted up, as it were, with\n",
      "a beam of benevolence and sweetness that I never saw equalled.  But he\n",
      "is generally melancholy and despairing, and sometimes he gnashes his\n",
      "teeth, as if impatient of the weight of woes that oppresses him.\n",
      "\n",
      "When my guest was a little recovered I had great trouble to keep off\n",
      "the men, who wished to ask him a thousand questions; but I would not\n",
      "allow him to be tormented by their idle curiosity, in a state of body\n",
      "and mind whose restoration evidently depended upon entire repose.\n",
      "Once, however, the lieutenant asked why he had come so far upon the ice\n",
      "in so strange a vehicle.\n",
      "\n",
      "His countenance instantly assumed an aspect of the deepest gloom, and\n",
      "he replied, “To seek one who fled from me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“And did the man whom you pursued travel in the same fashion?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Then I fancy we have seen him, for the day before we picked you up we\n",
      "saw some dogs drawing a sledge, with a man in it, across the ice.”\n",
      "\n",
      "This aroused the stranger’s attention, and he asked a multitude of\n",
      "questions concerning the route which the dæmon, as he called him, had\n",
      "pursued.  Soon after, when he was alone with me, he said, “I have,\n",
      "doubtless, excited your curiosity, as well as that of these good\n",
      "people; but you are too considerate to make inquiries.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Certainly; it would indeed be very impertinent and inhuman in me to\n",
      "trouble you with any inquisitiveness of mine.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“And yet you rescued me from a strange and perilous situation; you have\n",
      "benevolently restored me to life.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Soon after this he inquired if I thought that the breaking up of the\n",
      "ice had destroyed the other sledge.  I replied that I could not answer\n",
      "with any degree of certainty, for the ice had not broken until near\n",
      "midnight, and the traveller might have arrived at a place of safety\n",
      "before that time; but of this I could not judge.\n",
      "\n",
      "From this time a new spirit of life animated the decaying frame of the\n",
      "stranger. He manifested the greatest eagerness to be upon deck to watch for\n",
      "the sledge which had before appeared; but I have persuaded him to remain in\n",
      "the cabin, for he is far too weak to sustain the rawness of the atmosphere.\n",
      "I have promised that someone should watch for him and give him instant\n",
      "notice if any new object should appear in sight.\n",
      "\n",
      "Such is my journal of what relates to this strange occurrence up to the\n",
      "present day.  The stranger has gradually improved in health but is very\n",
      "silent and appears uneasy when anyone except myself enters his cabin.\n",
      "Yet his manners are so conciliating and gentle that the sailors are all\n",
      "interested in him, although they have had very little communication\n",
      "with him.  For my own part, I begin to love him as a brother, and his\n",
      "constant and deep grief fills me with sympathy and compassion.  He must\n",
      "have been a noble creature in his better days, being even now in wreck\n",
      "so attractive and amiable.\n",
      "\n",
      "I said in one of my letters, my dear Margaret, that I should find no friend\n",

      "admiration and my pity to an astonishing degree.  How can I see so\n",
      "noble a creature destroyed by misery without feeling the most poignant\n",
      "grief?  He is so gentle, yet so wise; his mind is so cultivated, and\n",
      "when he speaks, although his words are culled with the choicest art,\n",
      "yet they flow with rapidity and unparalleled eloquence.\n",
      "\n",
      "He is now much recovered from his illness and is continually on the deck,\n",
      "apparently watching for the sledge that preceded his own. Yet, although\n",
      "unhappy, he is not so utterly occupied by his own misery but that he\n",
      "interests himself deeply in the projects of others. He has frequently\n",
      "conversed with me on mine, which I have communicated to him without\n",
      "disguise. He entered attentively into all my arguments in favour of my\n",
      "eventual success and into every minute detail of the measures I had taken\n",
      "to secure it. I was easily led by the sympathy which he evinced to use the\n",
      "language of my heart, to give utterance to the burning ardour of my soul\n",
      "and to say, with all the fervour that warmed me, how gladly I would\n",
      "sacrifice my fortune, my existence, my every hope, to the furtherance of my\n",
      "enterprise. One man’s life or death were but a small price to pay for\n",
      "the acquirement of the knowledge which I sought, for the dominion I should\n",
      "acquire and transmit over the elemental foes of our race. As I spoke, a\n",
      "dark gloom spread over my listener’s countenance. At first I\n",
      "perceived that he tried to suppress his emotion; he placed his hands before\n",
      "his eyes, and my voice quivered and failed me as I beheld tears trickle\n",
      "fast from between his fingers; a groan burst from his heaving breast. I\n",
      "paused; at length he spoke, in broken accents: “Unhappy man! Do you\n",
      "share my madness? Have you drunk also of the intoxicating draught? Hear me;\n",
      "let me reveal my tale, and you will dash the cup from your lips!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Such words, you may imagine, strongly excited my curiosity; but the\n",
      "paroxysm of grief that had seized the stranger overcame his weakened\n",
      "powers, and many hours of repose and tranquil conversation were\n",
      "necessary to restore his composure.\n",
      "\n",
      "Having conquered the violence of his feelings, he appeared to despise\n",
      "himself for being the slave of passion; and quelling the dark tyranny of\n",
      "despair, he led me again to converse concerning myself personally. He asked\n",
      "me the history of my earlier years. The tale was quickly told, but it\n",
      "awakened various trains of reflection. I spoke of my desire of finding a\n",
      "friend, of my thirst for a more intimate sympathy with a fellow mind than\n",
      "had ever fallen to my lot, and expressed my conviction that a man could\n",
      "boast of little happiness who did not enjoy this blessing.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I agree with you,” replied the stranger; “we are\n",
      "unfashioned creatures, but half made up, if one wiser, better, dearer than\n",
      "ourselves—such a friend ought to be—do not lend his aid to\n",
      "perfectionate our weak and faulty natures. I once had a friend, the most\n",
      "noble of human creatures, and am entitled, therefore, to judge respecting\n",
      "friendship. You have hope, and the world before you, and have no cause for\n",

      "As he said this his countenance became expressive of a calm, settled\n",

      "\n",
      "Even broken in spirit as he is, no one can feel more deeply than he\n",
      "does the beauties of nature.  The starry sky, the sea, and every sight\n",
      "afforded by these wonderful regions seem still to have the power of\n",
      "elevating his soul from earth.  Such a man has a double existence:  he\n",
      "may suffer misery and be overwhelmed by disappointments, yet when he\n",

      "I am by birth a Genevese, and my family is one of the most\n",
      "distinguished of that republic.  My ancestors had been for many years\n",
      "counsellors and syndics, and my father had filled several public\n",
      "situations with honour and reputation.  He was respected by all who\n",
      "knew him for his integrity and indefatigable attention to public\n",
      "business.  He passed his younger days perpetually occupied by the\n",
      "affairs of his country; a variety of circumstances had prevented his\n",
      "marrying early, nor was it until the decline of life that he became a\n",
      "husband and the father of a family.\n",
      "\n",
      "As the circumstances of his marriage illustrate his character, I cannot\n",
      "refrain from relating them.  One of his most intimate friends was a\n",
      "merchant who, from a flourishing state, fell, through numerous\n",
      "mischances, into poverty.  This man, whose name was Beaufort, was of a\n",
      "proud and unbending disposition and could not bear to live in poverty\n",
      "and oblivion in the same country where he had formerly been\n",
      "distinguished for his rank and magnificence.  Having paid his debts,\n",
      "therefore, in the most honourable manner, he retreated with his\n",
      "daughter to the town of Lucerne, where he lived unknown and in\n",
      "wretchedness.  My father loved Beaufort with the truest friendship and\n",
      "was deeply grieved by his retreat in these unfortunate circumstances.\n",
      "He bitterly deplored the false pride which led his friend to a conduct\n",
      "so little worthy of the affection that united them.  He lost no time in\n",
      "endeavouring to seek him out, with the hope of persuading him to begin\n",
      "the world again through his credit and assistance.\n",
      "\n",
      "Beaufort had taken effectual measures to conceal himself, and it was ten\n",
      "months before my father discovered his abode. Overjoyed at this discovery,\n",
      "he hastened to the house, which was situated in a mean street near the\n",
      "Reuss. But when he entered, misery and despair alone welcomed him. Beaufort\n",
      "had saved but a very small sum of money from the wreck of his fortunes, but\n",
      "it was sufficient to provide him with sustenance for some months, and in\n",
      "the meantime he hoped to procure some respectable employment in a\n",
      "merchant’s house. The interval was, consequently, spent in inaction;\n",
      "his grief only became more deep and rankling when he had leisure for\n",
      "reflection, and at length it took so fast hold of his mind that at the end\n",
      "of three months he lay on a bed of sickness, incapable of any exertion.\n",
      "\n",
      "His daughter attended him with the greatest tenderness, but she saw\n",
      "with despair that their little fund was rapidly decreasing and that\n",
      "there was no other prospect of support.  But Caroline Beaufort\n",
      "possessed a mind of an uncommon mould, and her courage rose to support\n",
      "her in her adversity.  She procured plain work; she plaited straw and\n",
      "by various means contrived to earn a pittance scarcely sufficient to\n",
      "support life.\n",
      "\n",
      "Several months passed in this manner.  Her father grew worse; her time\n",
      "was more entirely occupied in attending him; her means of subsistence\n",
      "decreased; and in the tenth month her father died in her arms, leaving\n",
      "her an orphan and a beggar.  This last blow overcame her, and she knelt\n",
      "by Beaufort’s coffin weeping bitterly, when my father entered the\n",
      "chamber.  He came like a protecting spirit to the poor girl, who\n",
      "committed herself to his care; and after the interment of his friend he\n",
      "conducted her to Geneva and placed her under the protection of a\n",
      "relation.  Two years after this event Caroline became his wife.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was a considerable difference between the ages of my parents, but\n",
      "this circumstance seemed to unite them only closer in bonds of devoted\n",
      "affection.  There was a sense of justice in my father’s upright mind\n",
      "which rendered it necessary that he should approve highly to love\n",
      "strongly.  Perhaps during former years he had suffered from the\n",
      "late-discovered unworthiness of one beloved and so was disposed to set\n",
      "a greater value on tried worth.  There was a show of gratitude and\n",
      "worship in his attachment to my mother, differing wholly from the\n",
      "doting fondness of age, for it was inspired by reverence for her\n",
      "virtues and a desire to be the means of, in some degree, recompensing\n",
      "her for the sorrows she had endured, but which gave inexpressible grace\n",
      "to his behaviour to her.  Everything was made to yield to her wishes\n",
      "and her convenience.  He strove to shelter her, as a fair exotic is\n",
      "sheltered by the gardener, from every rougher wind and to surround her\n",
      "with all that could tend to excite pleasurable emotion in her soft and\n",
      "benevolent mind.  Her health, and even the tranquillity of her hitherto\n",
      "constant spirit, had been shaken by what she had gone through.  During\n",
      "the two years that had elapsed previous to their marriage my father had\n",
      "gradually relinquished all his public functions; and immediately after\n",
      "their union they sought the pleasant climate of Italy, and the change\n",
      "of scene and interest attendant on a tour through that land of wonders,\n",
      "as a restorative for her weakened frame.\n",
      "\n",
      "From Italy they visited Germany and France. I, their eldest child, was born\n",
      "at Naples, and as an infant accompanied them in their rambles. I remained\n",
      "for several years their only child. Much as they were attached to each\n",
      "other, they seemed to draw inexhaustible stores of affection from a very\n",
      "mine of love to bestow them upon me. My mother’s tender caresses and\n",
      "my father’s smile of benevolent pleasure while regarding me are my\n",
      "first recollections. I was their plaything and their idol, and something\n",
      "better—their child, the innocent and helpless creature bestowed on\n",
      "them by Heaven, whom to bring up to good, and whose future lot it was in\n",
      "their hands to direct to happiness or misery, according as they fulfilled\n",
      "their duties towards me. With this deep consciousness of what they owed\n",
      "towards the being to which they had given life, added to the active spirit\n",
      "of tenderness that animated both, it may be imagined that while during\n",
      "every hour of my infant life I received a lesson of patience, of charity,\n",
      "and of self-control, I was so guided by a silken cord that all seemed but\n",
      "one train of enjoyment to me.\n",
      "\n",
      "For a long time I was their only care. My mother had much desired to have a\n",
      "daughter, but I continued their single offspring. When I was about five\n",
      "years old, while making an excursion beyond the frontiers of Italy, they\n",
      "passed a week on the shores of the Lake of Como. Their benevolent\n",
      "disposition often made them enter the cottages of the poor. This, to my\n",
      "mother, was more than a duty; it was a necessity, a\n",
      "passion—remembering what she had suffered, and how she had been\n",
      "relieved—for her to act in her turn the guardian angel to the\n",
      "afflicted. During one of their walks a poor cot in the foldings of a vale\n",
      "attracted their notice as being singularly disconsolate, while the number\n",
      "of half-clothed children gathered about it spoke of penury in its worst\n",
      "shape. One day, when my father had gone by himself to Milan, my mother,\n",
      "accompanied by me, visited this abode. She found a peasant and his wife,\n",
      "hard working, bent down by care and labour, distributing a scanty meal to\n",
      "five hungry babes. Among these there was one which attracted my mother far\n",
      "above all the rest. She appeared of a different stock. The four others were\n",
      "dark-eyed, hardy little vagrants; this child was thin and very fair. Her\n",
      "hair was the brightest living gold, and despite the poverty of her\n",
      "clothing, seemed to set a crown of distinction on her head. Her brow was\n",
      "clear and ample, her blue eyes cloudless, and her lips and the moulding of\n",
      "her face so expressive of sensibility and sweetness that none could behold\n",
      "her without looking on her as of a distinct species, a being heaven-sent,\n",
      "and bearing a celestial stamp in all her features.\n",
      "\n",
      "The peasant woman, perceiving that my mother fixed eyes of wonder and\n",
      "admiration on this lovely girl, eagerly communicated her history. She was\n",
      "not her child, but the daughter of a Milanese nobleman. Her mother was a\n",
      "German and had died on giving her birth. The infant had been placed with\n",
      "these good people to nurse: they were better off then. They had not been\n",
      "long married, and their eldest child was but just born. The father of their\n",
      "charge was one of those Italians nursed in the memory of the antique glory\n",
      "of Italy—one among the _schiavi ognor frementi,_ who exerted\n",
      "himself to obtain the liberty of his country. He became the victim of its\n",
      "weakness. Whether he had died or still lingered in the dungeons of Austria\n",
      "was not known. His property was confiscated; his child became an orphan and\n",
      "a beggar. She continued with her foster parents and bloomed in their rude\n",
      "abode, fairer than a garden rose among dark-leaved brambles.\n",
      "\n",
      "When my father returned from Milan, he found playing with me in the hall of\n",
      "our villa a child fairer than pictured cherub—a creature who seemed\n",
      "to shed radiance from her looks and whose form and motions were lighter\n",
      "than the chamois of the hills. The apparition was soon explained. With his\n",
      "permission my mother prevailed on her rustic guardians to yield their\n",
      "charge to her. They were fond of the sweet orphan. Her presence had seemed\n",
      "a blessing to them, but it would be unfair to her to keep her in poverty\n",
      "and want when Providence afforded her such powerful protection. They\n",
      "consulted their village priest, and the result was that Elizabeth Lavenza\n",
      "became the inmate of my parents’ house—my more than\n",
      "sister—the beautiful and adored companion of all my occupations and\n",
      "my pleasures.\n",
      "\n",
      "Everyone loved Elizabeth.  The passionate and almost reverential\n",
      "attachment with which all regarded her became, while I shared it, my\n",
      "pride and my delight.  On the evening previous to her being brought to\n",
      "my home, my mother had said playfully, “I have a pretty present for my\n",
      "Victor—tomorrow he shall have it.”  And when, on the morrow, she\n",
      "presented Elizabeth to me as her promised gift, I, with childish\n",
      "seriousness, interpreted her words literally and looked upon Elizabeth\n",
      "as mine—mine to protect, love, and cherish.  All praises bestowed on\n",
      "her I received as made to a possession of my own.  We called each other\n",
      "familiarly by the name of cousin.  No word, no expression could body\n",

      "disunion or dispute.  Harmony was the soul of our companionship, and\n",
      "the diversity and contrast that subsisted in our characters drew us\n",
      "nearer together.  Elizabeth was of a calmer and more concentrated\n",

      "myself in the bonds of the closest friendship to one among them. Henry\n",
      "Clerval was the son of a merchant of Geneva. He was a boy of singular\n",
      "talent and fancy. He loved enterprise, hardship, and even danger for\n",
      "its own sake. He was deeply read in books of chivalry and romance.  He\n",
      "composed heroic songs and began to write many a tale of enchantment and\n",
      "knightly adventure. He tried to make us act plays and to enter into\n",
      "masquerades, in which the characters were drawn from the heroes of\n",

      "their caprice, but the agents and creators of all the many delights\n",
      "which we enjoyed.  When I mingled with other families I distinctly\n",

      "\n",
      "My temper was sometimes violent, and my passions vehement; but by some\n",
      "law in my temperature they were turned not towards childish pursuits\n",
      "but to an eager desire to learn, and not to learn all things\n",
      "indiscriminately.  I confess that neither the structure of languages,\n",
      "nor the code of governments, nor the politics of various states\n",
      "possessed attractions for me.  It was the secrets of heaven and earth\n",
      "that I desired to learn; and whether it was the outward substance of\n",
      "things or the inner spirit of nature and the mysterious soul of man\n",
      "that occupied me, still my inquiries were directed to the metaphysical,\n",

      "sullen in my study, rough through the ardour of my nature, but that\n",

      "Natural philosophy is the genius that has regulated my fate; I desire,\n",

      "on a party of pleasure to the baths near Thonon; the inclemency of the\n",
      "weather obliged us to remain a day confined to the inn. In this house I\n",

      "facts which he relates soon changed this feeling into enthusiasm. A new\n",
      "light seemed to dawn upon my mind, and bounding with joy, I communicated my\n",

      "former studies. It is even possible that the train of my ideas would never\n",

      "treasures known to few besides myself. I have described myself as always\n",
      "having been imbued with a fervent longing to penetrate the secrets of\n",
      "nature. In spite of the intense labour and wonderful discoveries of modern\n",
      "philosophers, I always came from my studies discontented and unsatisfied.\n",
      "Sir Isaac Newton is said to have avowed that he felt like a child picking\n",
      "up shells beside the great and unexplored ocean of truth. Those of his\n",
      "successors in each branch of natural philosophy with whom I was acquainted\n",

      "pursuit.\n",

      "The untaught peasant beheld the elements around him and was acquainted\n",
      "with their practical uses.  The most learned philosopher knew little\n",
      "more.  He had partially unveiled the face of Nature, but her immortal\n",
      "lineaments were still a wonder and a mystery.  He might dissect,\n",
      "anatomise, and give names; but, not to speak of a final cause, causes\n",
      "in their secondary and tertiary grades were utterly unknown to him.  I\n",
      "had gazed upon the fortifications and impediments that seemed to keep\n",
      "human beings from entering the citadel of nature, and rashly and\n",
      "ignorantly I had repined.\n",
      "\n",
      "But here were books, and here were men who had penetrated deeper and knew\n",
      "more. I took their word for all that they averred, and I became their\n",
      "disciple. It may appear strange that such should arise in the eighteenth\n",
      "century; but while I followed the routine of education in the schools of\n",
      "Geneva, I was, to a great degree, self-taught with regard to my favourite\n",

      "Under the guidance of my new preceptors I entered with the greatest\n",
      "diligence into the search of the philosopher’s stone and the elixir\n",

      "said, “really spent your time in studying such nonsense?”\n",
      "\n",
      "I replied in the affirmative.  “Every minute,” continued M. Krempe with\n",
      "warmth, “every instant that you have wasted on those books is utterly\n",

      "and useless names.  Good God!  In what desert land have you lived,\n",
      "where no one was kind enough to inform you that these fancies which you\n",
      "have so greedily imbibed are a thousand years old and as musty as they\n",

      "sir, you must begin your studies entirely anew.”\n",
      "\n",
      "So saying, he stepped aside and wrote down a list of several books\n",

      "dismissed me after mentioning that in the beginning of the following\n",
      "week he intended to commence a course of lectures upon natural\n",
      "philosophy in its general relations, and that M. Waldman, a fellow\n",

      "I returned home not disappointed, for I have said that I had long\n",
      "considered those authors useless whom the professor reprobated; but I\n",
      "returned not at all the more inclined to recur to these studies in any\n",
      "shape.  M. Krempe was a little squat man with a gruff voice and a\n",
      "repulsive countenance; the teacher, therefore, did not prepossess me in\n",
      "favour of his pursuits.  In rather a too philosophical and connected a\n",
      "strain, perhaps, I have given an account of the conclusions I had come\n",
      "to concerning them in my early years.  As a child I had not been\n",
      "content with the results promised by the modern professors of natural\n",
      "science.  With a confusion of ideas only to be accounted for by my\n",
      "extreme youth and my want of a guide on such matters, I had retrod the\n",
      "steps of knowledge along the paths of time and exchanged the\n",
      "discoveries of recent inquirers for the dreams of forgotten alchemists.\n",
      "Besides, I had a contempt for the uses of modern natural philosophy.\n",
      "It was very different when the masters of the science sought\n",
      "immortality and power; such views, although futile, were grand; but now\n",
      "the scene was changed.  The ambition of the inquirer seemed to limit\n",
      "itself to the annihilation of those visions on which my interest in\n",
      "science was chiefly founded.  I was required to exchange chimeras of\n",
      "boundless grandeur for realities of little worth.\n",
      "\n",
      "Such were my reflections during the first two or three days of my\n",
      "residence at Ingolstadt, which were chiefly spent in becoming\n",
      "acquainted with the localities and the principal residents in my new\n",
      "abode.  But as the ensuing week commenced, I thought of the information\n",
      "which M. Krempe had given me concerning the lectures.  And although I\n",
      "could not consent to go and hear that little conceited fellow deliver\n",
      "sentences out of a pulpit, I recollected what he had said of M.\n",
      "Waldman, whom I had never seen, as he had hitherto been out of town.\n",
      "\n",
      "Partly from curiosity and partly from idleness, I went into the lecturing\n",
      "room, which M. Waldman entered shortly after. This professor was very\n",
      "unlike his colleague. He appeared about fifty years of age, but with an\n",
      "aspect expressive of the greatest benevolence; a few grey hairs covered his\n",
      "temples, but those at the back of his head were nearly black. His person\n",
      "was short but remarkably erect and his voice the sweetest I had ever heard.\n",
      "He began his lecture by a recapitulation of the history of chemistry and\n",
      "the various improvements made by different men of learning, pronouncing\n",
      "with fervour the names of the most distinguished discoverers. He then took\n",
      "a cursory view of the present state of the science and explained many of\n",
      "its elementary terms. After having made a few preparatory experiments, he\n",
      "concluded with a panegyric upon modern chemistry, the terms of which I\n",
      "shall never forget:\n",
      "\n",
      "“The ancient teachers of this science,” said he,\n",
      "“promised impossibilities and performed nothing. The modern masters\n",
      "promise very little; they know that metals cannot be transmuted and that\n",
      "the elixir of life is a chimera but these philosophers, whose hands seem\n",
      "only made to dabble in dirt, and their eyes to pore over the microscope or\n",
      "crucible, have indeed performed miracles. They penetrate into the recesses\n",
      "of nature and show how she works in her hiding-places. They ascend into the\n",
      "heavens; they have discovered how the blood circulates, and the nature of\n",
      "the air we breathe. They have acquired new and almost unlimited powers;\n",
      "they can command the thunders of heaven, mimic the earthquake, and even\n",
      "mock the invisible world with its own shadows.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Such were the professor’s words—rather let me say such the words of\n",
      "the fate—enounced to destroy me.  As he went on I felt as if my soul\n",
      "were grappling with a palpable enemy; one by one the various keys were\n",
      "touched which formed the mechanism of my being; chord after chord was\n",
      "sounded, and soon my mind was filled with one thought, one conception,\n",
      "one purpose.  So much has been done, exclaimed the soul of\n",
      "Frankenstein—more, far more, will I achieve; treading in the steps\n",
      "already marked, I will pioneer a new way, explore unknown powers, and\n",
      "unfold to the world the deepest mysteries of creation.\n",
      "\n",
      "I closed not my eyes that night.  My internal being was in a state of\n",
      "insurrection and turmoil; I felt that order would thence arise, but I\n",
      "had no power to produce it.  By degrees, after the morning’s dawn,\n",
      "sleep came.  I awoke, and my yesternight’s thoughts were as a dream.\n",
      "There only remained a resolution to return to my ancient studies and to\n",
      "devote myself to a science for which I believed myself to possess a\n",
      "natural talent.  On the same day I paid M. Waldman a visit.  His\n",
      "manners in private were even more mild and attractive than in public,\n",
      "for there was a certain dignity in his mien during his lecture which in\n",
      "his own house was replaced by the greatest affability and kindness.  I\n",
      "gave him pretty nearly the same account of my former pursuits as I had\n",
      "given to his fellow professor.  He heard with attention the little\n",
      "narration concerning my studies and smiled at the names of Cornelius\n",
      "Agrippa and Paracelsus, but without the contempt that M. Krempe had\n",
      "exhibited. He said that “These were men to whose indefatigable zeal\n",
      "modern philosophers were indebted for most of the foundations of their\n",
      "knowledge.  They had left to us, as an easier task, to give new names\n",
      "and arrange in connected classifications the facts which they in a\n",
      "great degree had been the instruments of bringing to light.  The\n",
      "labours of men of genius, however erroneously directed, scarcely ever\n",
      "fail in ultimately turning to the solid advantage of mankind.”  I\n",
      "listened to his statement, which was delivered without any presumption\n",
      "or affectation, and then added that his lecture had removed my\n",
      "prejudices against modern chemists; I expressed myself in measured\n",
      "terms, with the modesty and deference due from a youth to his\n",
      "instructor, without letting escape (inexperience in life would have\n",
      "made me ashamed) any of the enthusiasm which stimulated my intended\n",
      "labours.  I requested his advice concerning the books I ought to\n",
      "procure.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am happy,” said M. Waldman, “to have gained a\n",
      "disciple; and if your application equals your ability, I have no doubt of\n",
      "your success. Chemistry is that branch of natural philosophy in which the\n",
      "greatest improvements have been and may be made; it is on that account that\n",
      "I have made it my peculiar study; but at the same time, I have not\n",
      "neglected the other branches of science. A man would make but a very sorry\n",
      "chemist if he attended to that department of human knowledge alone. If your\n",
      "wish is to become really a man of science and not merely a petty\n",
      "experimentalist, I should advise you to apply to every branch of natural\n",
      "philosophy, including mathematics.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He then took me into his laboratory and explained to me the uses of his\n",
      "various machines, instructing me as to what I ought to procure and\n",
      "promising me the use of his own when I should have advanced far enough in\n",
      "the science not to derange their mechanism. He also gave me the list of\n",
      "books which I had requested, and I took my leave.\n",

      "most comprehensive sense of the term, became nearly my sole occupation.\n",
      "I read with ardour those works, so full of genius and discrimination,\n",
      "which modern inquirers have written on these subjects.  I attended the\n",
      "lectures and cultivated the acquaintance of the men of science of the\n",
      "university, and I found even in M. Krempe a great deal of sound sense\n",
      "and real information, combined, it is true, with a repulsive\n",
      "physiognomy and manners, but not on that account the less valuable.  In\n",
      "M. Waldman I found a true friend.  His gentleness was never tinged by\n",
      "dogmatism, and his instructions were given with an air of frankness and\n",
      "good nature that banished every idea of pedantry.  In a thousand ways\n",
      "he smoothed for me the path of knowledge and made the most abstruse\n",

      "with a sly smile, how Cornelius Agrippa went on, whilst M. Waldman\n",
      "expressed the most heartfelt exultation in my progress.  Two years\n",
      "passed in this manner, during which I paid no visit to Geneva, but was\n",
      "engaged, heart and soul, in the pursuit of some discoveries which I\n",
      "hoped to make.  None but those who have experienced them can conceive\n",
      "of the enticements of science.  In other studies you go as far as\n",
      "others have gone before you, and there is nothing more to know; but in\n",
      "a scientific pursuit there is continual food for discovery and wonder.\n",
      "A mind of moderate capacity which closely pursues one study must\n",

      "food for the worm.  Now I was led to examine the cause and progress of\n",
      "this decay and forced to spend days and nights in vaults and\n",
      "charnel-houses.  My attention was fixed upon every object the most\n",
      "insupportable to the delicacy of the human feelings.  I saw how the\n",

      "wondrous, yet so simple, that while I became dizzy with the immensity\n",
      "of the prospect which it illustrated, I was surprised that among so\n",

      "most gratifying consummation of my toils.  But this discovery was so\n",
      "great and overwhelming that all the steps by which I had been\n",

      "What had been the study and desire of the wisest men since the creation\n",
      "of the world was now within my grasp.  Not that, like a magic scene, it\n",

      "nature rather to direct my endeavours so soon as I should point them\n",
      "towards the object of my search than to exhibit that object already\n",
      "accomplished.  I was like the Arabian who had been buried with the dead\n",

      "adequate to so arduous an undertaking, but I doubted not that I should\n",

      "could I consider the magnitude and complexity of my plan as any\n",

      "formed a great hindrance to my speed, I resolved, contrary to my first\n",
      "intention, to make the being of a gigantic stature, that is to say,\n",
      "about eight feet in height, and proportionably large.  After having\n",
      "formed this determination and having spent some months in successfully\n",
      "collecting and arranging my materials, I began.\n",
      "\n",
      "No one can conceive the variety of feelings which bore me onwards, like\n",
      "a hurricane, in the first enthusiasm of success.  Life and death\n",
      "appeared to me ideal bounds, which I should first break through, and\n",
      "pour a torrent of light into our dark world.  A new species would bless\n",
      "me as its creator and source; many happy and excellent natures would\n",
      "owe their being to me.  No father could claim the gratitude of his\n",
      "child so completely as I should deserve theirs.  Pursuing these\n",
      "reflections, I thought that if I could bestow animation upon lifeless\n",
      "matter, I might in process of time (although I now found it impossible)\n",
      "renew life where death had apparently devoted the body to corruption.\n",

      "brink of certainty, I failed; yet still I clung to the hope which the\n",
      "next day or the next hour might realise.  One secret which I alone\n",

      "of the grave or tortured the living animal to animate the lifeless\n",
      "clay?  My limbs now tremble, and my eyes swim with the remembrance; but\n",
      "then a resistless and almost frantic impulse urged me forward; I seemed\n",
      "to have lost all soul or sensation but for this one pursuit.  It was\n",
      "indeed but a passing trance, that only made me feel with renewed\n",
      "acuteness so soon as, the unnatural stimulus ceasing to operate, I had\n",
      "returned to my old habits.  I collected bones from charnel-houses and\n",
      "disturbed, with profane fingers, the tremendous secrets of the human\n",
      "frame.  In a solitary chamber, or rather cell, at the top of the house,\n",
      "and separated from all the other apartments by a gallery and staircase,\n",
      "I kept my workshop of filthy creation; my eyeballs were starting from\n",
      "their sockets in attending to the details of my employment.  The\n",
      "dissecting room and the slaughter-house furnished many of my materials;\n",
      "and often did my human nature turn with loathing from my occupation,\n",

      "vintage, but my eyes were insensible to the charms of nature.  And the\n",
      "same feelings which made me neglect the scenes around me caused me also\n",
      "to forget those friends who were so many miles absent, and whom I had\n",
      "not seen for so long a time.  I knew my silence disquieted them, and I\n",
      "well remembered the words of my father:  “I know that while you are\n",
      "pleased with yourself you will think of us with affection, and we shall\n",
      "hear regularly from you.  You must pardon me if I regard any\n",
      "interruption in your correspondence as a proof that your other duties\n",

      "to vice or faultiness on my part, but I am now convinced that he was\n",
      "justified in conceiving that I should not be altogether free from\n",
      "blame.  A human being in perfection ought always to preserve a calm and\n",
      "peaceful mind and never to allow passion or a transitory desire to\n",
      "disturb his tranquillity.  I do not think that the pursuit of knowledge\n",
      "is an exception to this rule.  If the study to which you apply yourself\n",
      "has a tendency to weaken your affections and to destroy your taste for\n",
      "those simple pleasures in which no alloy can possibly mix, then that\n",
      "study is certainly unlawful, that is to say, not befitting the human\n",

      "rushed out of the room and continued a long time traversing my\n",

      "succeeded to the tumult I had before endured, and I threw myself on the\n",
      "bed in my clothes, endeavouring to seek a few moments of forgetfulness.\n",
      "But it was in vain; I slept, indeed, but I was disturbed by the wildest\n",

      "created.  He held up the curtain of the bed; and his eyes, if eyes they\n",
      "may be called, were fixed on me.  His jaws opened, and he muttered some\n",
      "inarticulate sounds, while a grin wrinkled his cheeks.  He might have\n",
      "spoken, but I did not hear; one hand was stretched out, seemingly to\n",
      "detain me, but I escaped and rushed downstairs.  I took refuge in the\n",
      "courtyard belonging to the house which I inhabited, where I remained\n",

      "beat rapidly.  I was unable to remain for a single instant in the same\n",
      "place; I jumped over the chairs, clapped my hands, and laughed aloud.\n",
      "Clerval at first attributed my unusual spirits to joy on his arrival,\n",
      "but when he observed me more attentively, he saw a wildness in my eyes\n",

      "for so long a journey, and how wretched my sickness would make\n",
      "Elizabeth, he spared them this grief by concealing the extent of my\n",
      "disorder.  He knew that I could not have a more kind and attentive\n",
      "nurse than himself; and, firm in the hope he felt of my recovery, he\n",
      "did not doubt that, instead of doing harm, he performed the kindest\n",
      "action that he could towards them.\n",
      "\n",
      "But I was in reality very ill, and surely nothing but the unbounded and\n",
      "unremitting attentions of my friend could have restored me to life.\n",
      "The form of the monster on whom I had bestowed existence was for ever\n",
      "before my eyes, and I raved incessantly concerning him.  Doubtless my\n",
      "words surprised Henry; he at first believed them to be the wanderings\n",
      "of my disturbed imagination, but the pertinacity with which I\n",
      "continually recurred to the same subject persuaded him that my disorder\n",
      "indeed owed its origin to some uncommon and terrible event.\n",
      "\n",
      "By very slow degrees, and with frequent relapses that alarmed and\n",
      "grieved my friend, I recovered.  I remember the first time I became\n",
      "capable of observing outward objects with any kind of pleasure, I\n",
      "perceived that the fallen leaves had disappeared and that the young\n",
      "buds were shooting forth from the trees that shaded my window.  It was\n",
      "a divine spring, and the season contributed greatly to my\n",
      "convalescence.  I felt also sentiments of joy and affection revive in\n",

      "cheerful as before I was attacked by the fatal passion.\n",

      "what occasion Justine Moritz entered our family?  Probably you do not;\n",
      "I will relate her history, therefore in a few words.  Madame Moritz,\n",
      "her mother, was a widow with four children, of whom Justine was the\n",
      "third.  This girl had always been the favourite of her father, but\n",
      "through a strange perversity, her mother could not endure her, and\n",
      "after the death of M. Moritz, treated her very ill.  My aunt observed\n",
      "this, and when Justine was twelve years of age, prevailed on her mother\n",
      "to allow her to live at our house.  The republican institutions of our\n",
      "country have produced simpler and happier manners than those which\n",
      "prevail in the great monarchies that surround it.  Hence there is less\n",
      "distinction between the several classes of its inhabitants; and the\n",
      "lower orders, being neither so poor nor so despised, their manners are\n",
      "more refined and moral.  A servant in Geneva does not mean the same\n",
      "thing as a servant in France and England.  Justine, thus received in\n",
      "our family, learned the duties of a servant, a condition which, in our\n",
      "fortunate country, does not include the idea of ignorance and a\n",
      "sacrifice of the dignity of a human being.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Justine, you may remember, was a great favourite of yours; and I\n",
      "recollect you once remarked that if you were in an ill humour, one\n",
      "glance from Justine could dissipate it, for the same reason that\n",
      "Ariosto gives concerning the beauty of Angelica—she looked so\n",
      "frank-hearted and happy.  My aunt conceived a great attachment for her,\n",
      "by which she was induced to give her an education superior to that\n",
      "which she had at first intended.  This benefit was fully repaid;\n",
      "Justine was the most grateful little creature in the world:  I do not\n",
      "mean that she made any professions I never heard one pass her lips, but\n",
      "you could see by her eyes that she almost adored her protectress.\n",
      "Although her disposition was gay and in many respects inconsiderate,\n",
      "yet she paid the greatest attention to every gesture of my aunt.  She\n",
      "thought her the model of all excellence and endeavoured to imitate her\n",
      "phraseology and manners, so that even now she often reminds me of her.\n",

      "“When my dearest aunt died every one was too much occupied in their own\n",
      "grief to notice poor Justine, who had attended her during her illness\n",

      "trials were reserved for her.\n",
      "\n",
      "“One by one, her brothers and sister died; and her mother, with the\n",
      "exception of her neglected daughter, was left childless.  The\n",
      "conscience of the woman was troubled; she began to think that the\n",
      "deaths of her favourites was a judgement from heaven to chastise her\n",
      "partiality.  She was a Roman Catholic; and I believe her confessor\n",
      "confirmed the idea which she had conceived.  Accordingly, a few months\n",
      "after your departure for Ingolstadt, Justine was called home by her\n",
      "repentant mother.  Poor girl!  She wept when she quitted our house; she\n",
      "was much altered since the death of my aunt; grief had given softness\n",
      "and a winning mildness to her manners, which had before been remarkable\n",
      "for vivacity.  Nor was her residence at her mother’s house of a nature\n",
      "to restore her gaiety.  The poor woman was very vacillating in her\n",
      "repentance.  She sometimes begged Justine to forgive her unkindness,\n",
      "but much oftener accused her of having caused the deaths of her\n",
      "brothers and sister.  Perpetual fretting at length threw Madame Moritz\n",
      "into a decline, which at first increased her irritability, but she is\n",
      "now at peace for ever.  She died on the first approach of cold weather,\n",
      "at the beginning of this last winter.  Justine has just returned to us;\n",
      "and I assure you I love her tenderly.  She is very clever and gentle,\n",

      "beginning of my misfortunes, I had conceived a violent antipathy even\n",
      "to the name of natural philosophy.  When I was otherwise quite restored\n",

      "apparatus from my view.  He had also changed my apartment; for he\n",
      "perceived that I had acquired a dislike for the room which had\n",

      "no avail when I visited the professors.  M. Waldman inflicted torture\n",
      "when he praised, with kindness and warmth, the astonishing progress I\n",
      "had made in the sciences.  He soon perceived that I disliked the\n",
      "subject; but not guessing the real cause, he attributed my feelings to\n",
      "modesty, and changed the subject from my improvement, to the science\n",
      "itself, with a desire, as I evidently saw, of drawing me out.  What\n",
      "could I do?  He meant to please, and he tormented me.  I felt as if he\n",
      "had placed carefully, one by one, in my view those instruments which\n",

      "total ignorance; and the conversation took a more general turn.  I\n",
      "thanked my friend from my heart, but I did not speak.  I saw plainly\n",

      "youngster who, but a few years ago, believed in Cornelius Agrippa as firmly\n",

      "inglorious career, he turned his eyes toward the East, as affording\n",
      "scope for his spirit of enterprise.  The Persian, Arabic, and Sanskrit\n",
      "languages engaged his attention, and I was easily induced to enter on\n",
      "the same studies.  Idleness had ever been irksome to me, and now that I\n",
      "wished to fly from reflection, and hated my former studies, I felt\n",
      "great relief in being the fellow-pupil with my friend, and found not\n",
      "only instruction but consolation in the works of the orientalists.  I\n",
      "did not, like him, attempt a critical knowledge of their dialects, for\n",
      "I did not contemplate making any other use of them than temporary\n",
      "amusement.  I read merely to understand their meaning, and they well\n",
      "repaid my labours.  Their melancholy is soothing, and their joy\n",
      "elevating, to a degree I never experienced in studying the authors of\n",
      "any other country.  When you read their writings, life appears to\n",
      "consist in a warm sun and a garden of roses,—in the smiles and frowns\n",

      "\n",
      "We passed a fortnight in these perambulations:  my health and spirits\n",

      "child.  “Dear mountains! my own beautiful lake! how do you welcome your\n",

      "placid.  Is this to prognosticate peace, or to mock at my unhappiness?”\n",

      "I fear, my friend, that I shall render myself tedious by dwelling on\n",

      "beholding thy streams, thy mountains, and, more than all, thy lovely\n",
      "lake!\n",

      "Yet, as I drew nearer home, grief and fear again overcame me. Night also\n",
      "closed around; and when I could hardly see the dark mountains, I felt still\n",
      "more gloomily. The picture appeared a vast and dim scene of evil, and I\n",
      "foresaw obscurely that I was destined to become the most wretched of human\n",
      "beings. Alas! I prophesied truly, and failed only in one single\n",
      "circumstance, that in all the misery I imagined and dreaded, I did not\n",
      "conceive the hundredth part of the anguish I was destined to endure.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was completely dark when I arrived in the environs of Geneva; the gates\n",
      "of the town were already shut; and I was obliged to pass the night at\n",
      "Secheron, a village at the distance of half a league from the city. The sky\n",
      "was serene; and, as I was unable to rest, I resolved to visit the spot\n",
      "where my poor William had been murdered. As I could not pass through the\n",
      "town, I was obliged to cross the lake in a boat to arrive at Plainpalais.\n",
      "During this short voyage I saw the lightning playing on the summit of Mont\n",
      "Blanc in the most beautiful figures. The storm appeared to approach\n",
      "rapidly, and, on landing, I ascended a low hill, that I might observe its\n",
      "progress. It advanced; the heavens were clouded, and I soon felt the rain\n",
      "coming slowly in large drops, but its violence quickly increased.\n",
      "\n",
      "I quitted my seat, and walked on, although the darkness and storm\n",
      "increased every minute, and the thunder burst with a terrific crash\n",
      "over my head.  It was echoed from Salêve, the Juras, and the Alps of\n",
      "Savoy; vivid flashes of lightning dazzled my eyes, illuminating the\n",
      "lake, making it appear like a vast sheet of fire; then for an instant\n",
      "every thing seemed of a pitchy darkness, until the eye recovered itself\n",
      "from the preceding flash.  The storm, as is often the case in\n",
      "Switzerland, appeared at once in various parts of the heavens. The\n",
      "most violent storm hung exactly north of the town, over the part of the\n",
      "lake which lies between the promontory of Belrive and the village of\n",
      "Copêt. Another storm enlightened Jura with faint flashes; and another\n",
      "darkened and sometimes disclosed the Môle, a peaked mountain to the\n",
      "east of the lake.\n",
      "\n",
      "While I watched the tempest, so beautiful yet terrific, I wandered on with\n",
      "a hasty step. This noble war in the sky elevated my spirits; I clasped my\n",
      "hands, and exclaimed aloud, “William, dear angel! this is thy\n",
      "funeral, this thy dirge!” As I said these words, I perceived in the\n",
      "gloom a figure which stole from behind a clump of trees near me; I stood\n",
      "fixed, gazing intently: I could not be mistaken. A flash of lightning\n",
      "illuminated the object, and discovered its shape plainly to me; its\n",
      "gigantic stature, and the deformity of its aspect more hideous than belongs\n",
      "to humanity, instantly informed me that it was the wretch, the filthy\n",
      "dæmon, to whom I had given life. What did he there? Could he be (I\n",
      "shuddered at the conception) the murderer of my brother? No sooner did that\n",
      "idea cross my imagination, than I became convinced of its truth; my teeth\n",
      "chattered, and I was forced to lean against a tree for support. The figure\n",
      "passed me quickly, and I lost it in the gloom. Nothing in human shape could\n",
      "have destroyed the fair child. _He_ was the murderer! I could not\n",
      "doubt it. The mere presence of the idea was an irresistible proof of the\n",
      "fact. I thought of pursuing the devil; but it would have been in vain, for\n",
      "another flash discovered him to me hanging among the rocks of the nearly\n",
      "perpendicular ascent of Mont Salêve, a hill that bounds Plainpalais on the\n",
      "south. He soon reached the summit, and disappeared.\n",
      "\n",
      "I remained motionless.  The thunder ceased; but the rain still\n",
      "continued, and the scene was enveloped in an impenetrable darkness.  I\n",
      "revolved in my mind the events which I had until now sought to forget:\n",
      "the whole train of my progress toward the creation; the appearance of\n",
      "the works of my own hands at my bedside; its departure.  Two years had\n",
      "now nearly elapsed since the night on which he first received life; and\n",
      "was this his first crime?  Alas!  I had turned loose into the world a\n",
      "depraved wretch, whose delight was in carnage and misery; had he not\n",
      "murdered my brother?\n",
      "\n",
      "No one can conceive the anguish I suffered during the remainder of the\n",
      "night, which I spent, cold and wet, in the open air.  But I did not\n",
      "feel the inconvenience of the weather; my imagination was busy in\n",
      "scenes of evil and despair.  I considered the being whom I had cast\n",
      "among mankind, and endowed with the will and power to effect purposes\n",
      "of horror, such as the deed which he had now done, nearly in the light\n",
      "of my own vampire, my own spirit let loose from the grave, and forced\n",
      "to destroy all that was dear to me.\n",
      "\n",
      "Day dawned; and I directed my steps towards the town.  The gates were\n",
      "open, and I hastened to my father’s house.  My first thought was to\n",
      "discover what I knew of the murderer, and cause instant pursuit to be\n",
      "made.  But I paused when I reflected on the story that I had to tell. A\n",
      "being whom I myself had formed, and endued with life, had met me at\n",
      "midnight among the precipices of an inaccessible mountain.  I\n",
      "remembered also the nervous fever with which I had been seized just at\n",
      "the time that I dated my creation, and which would give an air of\n",
      "delirium to a tale otherwise so utterly improbable.  I well knew that\n",
      "if any other had communicated such a relation to me, I should have\n",
      "looked upon it as the ravings of insanity.  Besides, the strange nature\n",
      "of the animal would elude all pursuit, even if I were so far credited\n",
      "as to persuade my relatives to commence it.  And then of what use would\n",
      "be pursuit?  Who could arrest a creature capable of scaling the\n",
      "overhanging sides of Mont Salêve?  These reflections determined me, and\n",
      "I resolved to remain silent.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was about five in the morning when I entered my father’s house.  I\n",
      "told the servants not to disturb the family, and went into the library\n",
      "to attend their usual hour of rising.\n",
      "\n",
      "Six years had elapsed, passed in a dream but for one indelible trace, and I\n",
      "stood in the same place where I had last embraced my father before my\n",
      "departure for Ingolstadt. Beloved and venerable parent! He still remained\n",
      "to me. I gazed on the picture of my mother, which stood over the\n",
      "mantel-piece. It was an historical subject, painted at my father’s\n",
      "desire, and represented Caroline Beaufort in an agony of despair, kneeling\n",
      "by the coffin of her dead father. Her garb was rustic, and her cheek pale;\n",
      "but there was an air of dignity and beauty, that hardly permitted the\n",
      "sentiment of pity. Below this picture was a miniature of William; and my\n",
      "tears flowed when I looked upon it. While I was thus engaged, Ernest\n",
      "entered: he had heard me arrive, and hastened to welcome me:\n",
      "“Welcome, my dearest Victor,” said he. “Ah! I wish you\n",
      "had come three months ago, and then you would have found us all joyous and\n",
      "delighted. You come to us now to share a misery which nothing can\n",
      "alleviate; yet your presence will, I hope, revive our father, who seems\n",
      "sinking under his misfortune; and your persuasions will induce poor\n",
      "Elizabeth to cease her vain and tormenting self-accusations.—Poor\n",
      "William! he was our darling and our pride!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Tears, unrestrained, fell from my brother’s eyes; a sense of mortal\n",
      "agony crept over my frame.  Before, I had only imagined the\n",
      "wretchedness of my desolated home; the reality came on me as a new, and\n",
      "a not less terrible, disaster.  I tried to calm Ernest; I enquired more\n",
      "minutely concerning my father, and here I named my cousin.\n",
      "\n",
      "“She most of all,” said Ernest, “requires consolation; she accused\n",
      "herself of having caused the death of my brother, and that made her\n",
      "very wretched.  But since the murderer has been discovered—”\n",
      "\n",
      "“The murderer discovered!  Good God! how can that be? who could attempt\n",
      "to pursue him?  It is impossible; one might as well try to overtake the\n",
      "winds, or confine a mountain-stream with a straw.  I saw him too; he\n",
      "was free last night!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I do not know what you mean,” replied my brother, in accents of\n",
      "wonder, “but to us the discovery we have made completes our misery.  No\n",
      "one would believe it at first; and even now Elizabeth will not be\n",
      "convinced, notwithstanding all the evidence.  Indeed, who would credit\n",
      "that Justine Moritz, who was so amiable, and fond of all the family,\n",
      "could suddenly become so capable of so frightful, so appalling a crime?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Justine Moritz!  Poor, poor girl, is she the accused?  But it is\n",
      "wrongfully; every one knows that; no one believes it, surely, Ernest?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No one did at first; but several circumstances came out, that have\n",
      "almost forced conviction upon us; and her own behaviour has been so\n",
      "confused, as to add to the evidence of facts a weight that, I fear,\n",
      "leaves no hope for doubt.  But she will be tried today, and you will\n",
      "then hear all.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He then related that, the morning on which the murder of poor William\n",
      "had been discovered, Justine had been taken ill, and confined to her\n",
      "bed for several days.  During this interval, one of the servants,\n",
      "happening to examine the apparel she had worn on the night of the\n",
      "murder, had discovered in her pocket the picture of my mother, which\n",
      "had been judged to be the temptation of the murderer.  The servant\n",
      "instantly showed it to one of the others, who, without saying a word to\n",
      "any of the family, went to a magistrate; and, upon their deposition,\n",
      "Justine was apprehended.  On being charged with the fact, the poor girl\n",
      "confirmed the suspicion in a great measure by her extreme confusion of\n",
      "manner.\n",
      "\n",
      "This was a strange tale, but it did not shake my faith; and I replied\n",
      "earnestly, “You are all mistaken; I know the murderer.  Justine, poor,\n",
      "good Justine, is innocent.”\n",
      "\n",
      "At that instant my father entered.  I saw unhappiness deeply impressed\n",
      "on his countenance, but he endeavoured to welcome me cheerfully; and,\n",
      "after we had exchanged our mournful greeting, would have introduced\n",
      "some other topic than that of our disaster, had not Ernest exclaimed,\n",
      "“Good God, papa!  Victor says that he knows who was the murderer of\n",
      "poor William.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“We do also, unfortunately,” replied my father, “for indeed I had\n",
      "rather have been for ever ignorant than have discovered so much\n",
      "depravity and ungratitude in one I valued so highly.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“My dear father, you are mistaken; Justine is innocent.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“If she is, God forbid that she should suffer as guilty.  She is to be\n",
      "tried today, and I hope, I sincerely hope, that she will be acquitted.”\n",
      "\n",
      "This speech calmed me.  I was firmly convinced in my own mind that\n",
      "Justine, and indeed every human being, was guiltless of this murder.  I\n",
      "had no fear, therefore, that any circumstantial evidence could be\n",
      "brought forward strong enough to convict her.  My tale was not one to\n",
      "announce publicly; its astounding horror would be looked upon as\n",
      "madness by the vulgar.  Did any one indeed exist, except I, the\n",
      "creator, who would believe, unless his senses convinced him, in the\n",
      "existence of the living monument of presumption and rash ignorance\n",
      "which I had let loose upon the world?\n",
      "\n",
      "We were soon joined by Elizabeth.  Time had altered her since I last\n",
      "beheld her; it had endowed her with loveliness surpassing the beauty of\n",
      "her childish years.  There was the same candour, the same vivacity, but\n",
      "it was allied to an expression more full of sensibility and intellect.\n",
      "She welcomed me with the greatest affection.  “Your arrival, my dear\n",
      "cousin,” said she, “fills me with hope.  You perhaps will find some\n",
      "means to justify my poor guiltless Justine.  Alas! who is safe, if she\n",
      "be convicted of crime?  I rely on her innocence as certainly as I do\n",
      "upon my own.  Our misfortune is doubly hard to us; we have not only\n",
      "lost that lovely darling boy, but this poor girl, whom I sincerely\n",
      "love, is to be torn away by even a worse fate.  If she is condemned, I\n",
      "never shall know joy more.  But she will not, I am sure she will not;\n",
      "and then I shall be happy again, even after the sad death of my little\n",
      "William.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“She is innocent, my Elizabeth,” said I, “and that shall\n",
      "be proved; fear nothing, but let your spirits be cheered by the assurance\n",
      "of her acquittal.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“How kind and generous you are! every one else believes in her guilt,\n",
      "and that made me wretched, for I knew that it was impossible:  and to\n",
      "see every one else prejudiced in so deadly a manner rendered me\n",
      "hopeless and despairing.”  She wept.\n",

      "The appearance of Justine was calm.  She was dressed in mourning, and\n",

      "thousands, for all the kindness which her beauty might otherwise have\n",

      "was tranquil, yet her tranquillity was evidently constrained; and as\n",

      "worked up her mind to an appearance of courage.  When she entered the\n",

      "of her innocence as I had.  She had been out the whole of the night on\n",
      "which the murder had been committed and towards morning had been\n",

      "and unintelligible answer.  She returned to the house about eight\n",
      "o’clock, and when one inquired where she had passed the night, she\n",
      "replied that she had been looking for the child and demanded earnestly\n",
      "if anything had been heard concerning him.  When shown the body, she\n",
      "fell into violent hysterics and kept her bed for several days.  The\n",
      "picture was then produced which the servant had found in her pocket;\n",
      "and when Elizabeth, in a faltering voice, proved that it was the same\n",

      "Geneva.  On her return, at about nine o’clock, she met a man who asked\n",
      "her if she had seen anything of the child who was lost.  She was\n",
      "alarmed by this account and passed several hours in looking for him,\n",
      "when the gates of Geneva were shut, and she was forced to remain\n",
      "several hours of the night in a barn belonging to a cottage, being\n",
      "unwilling to call up the inhabitants, to whom she was well known.  Most\n",
      "of the night she spent here watching; towards morning she believed that\n",
      "she slept for a few minutes; some steps disturbed her, and she awoke.\n",
      "It was dawn, and she quitted her asylum, that she might again endeavour\n",
      "to find my brother.  If she had gone near the spot where his body lay,\n",
      "it was without her knowledge.  That she had been bewildered when\n",
      "questioned by the market-woman was not surprising, since she had passed\n",

      "explaining it; and when I have expressed my utter ignorance, I am only left\n",
      "to conjecture concerning the probabilities by which it might have been\n",
      "placed in my pocket. But here also I am checked. I believe that I have no\n",
      "enemy on earth, and none surely would have been so wicked as to destroy me\n",
      "wantonly. Did the murderer place it there? I know of no opportunity\n",

      "Several witnesses were called who had known her for many years, and\n",
      "they spoke well of her; but fear and hatred of the crime of which they\n",

      "know of her character. I am well acquainted with the accused. I have lived\n",
      "in the same house with her, at one time for five and at another for nearly\n",
      "two years. During all that period she appeared to me the most amiable and\n",
      "benevolent of human creatures. She nursed Madame Frankenstein, my aunt, in\n",
      "her last illness, with the greatest affection and care and afterwards\n",
      "attended her own mother during a tedious illness, in a manner that excited\n",
      "the admiration of all who knew her, after which she again lived in my\n",
      "uncle’s house, where she was beloved by all the family. She was\n",
      "warmly attached to the child who is now dead and acted towards him like a\n",
      "most affectionate mother. For my own part, I do not hesitate to say that,\n",
      "notwithstanding all the evidence produced against her, I believe and rely\n",
      "on her perfect innocence. She had no temptation for such an action; as to\n",
      "the bauble on which the chief proof rests, if she had earnestly desired it,\n",

      "A murmur of approbation followed Elizabeth’s simple and powerful\n",
      "appeal, but it was excited by her generous interference, and not in\n",
      "favour of poor Justine, on whom the public indignation was turned with\n",
      "renewed violence, charging her with the blackest ingratitude.  She\n",
      "herself wept as Elizabeth spoke, but she did not answer.  My own\n",
      "agitation and anguish was extreme during the whole trial.  I believed\n",
      "in her innocence; I knew it.  Could the dæmon who had (I did not for a\n",
      "minute doubt) murdered my brother also in his hellish sport have\n",
      "betrayed the innocent to death and ignominy?  I could not sustain the\n",
      "horror of my situation, and when I perceived that the popular voice and\n",
      "the countenances of the judges had already condemned my unhappy victim,\n",
      "I rushed out of the court in agony.  The tortures of the accused did\n",
      "not equal mine; she was sustained by innocence, but the fangs of\n",
      "remorse tore my bosom and would not forgo their hold.\n",
      "\n",
      "I passed a night of unmingled wretchedness.  In the morning I went to\n",
      "the court; my lips and throat were parched.  I dared not ask the fatal\n",
      "question, but I was known, and the officer guessed the cause of my\n",
      "visit.  The ballots had been thrown; they were all black, and Justine\n",
      "was condemned.\n",
      "\n",
      "I cannot pretend to describe what I then felt.  I had before\n",
      "experienced sensations of horror, and I have endeavoured to bestow upon\n",
      "them adequate expressions, but words cannot convey an idea of the\n",
      "heart-sickening despair that I then endured.  The person to whom I\n",
      "addressed myself added that Justine had already confessed her guilt.\n",
      "“That evidence,” he observed, “was hardly required in so glaring a\n",
      "case, but I am glad of it, and, indeed, none of our judges like to\n",
      "condemn a criminal upon circumstantial evidence, be it ever so\n",
      "decisive.”\n",
      "\n",
      "This was strange and unexpected intelligence; what could it mean?  Had\n",
      "my eyes deceived me?  And was I really as mad as the whole world would\n",
      "believe me to be if I disclosed the object of my suspicions?  I\n",
      "hastened to return home, and Elizabeth eagerly demanded the result.\n",
      "\n",
      "“My cousin,” replied I, “it is decided as you may have expected; all\n",
      "judges had rather that ten innocent should suffer than that one guilty\n",
      "should escape.  But she has confessed.”\n",
      "\n",
      "This was a dire blow to poor Elizabeth, who had relied with firmness upon\n",
      "Justine’s innocence. “Alas!” said she. “How shall I\n",
      "ever again believe in human goodness? Justine, whom I loved and esteemed as\n",
      "my sister, how could she put on those smiles of innocence only to betray?\n",
      "Her mild eyes seemed incapable of any severity or guile, and yet she has\n",
      "committed a murder.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Soon after we heard that the poor victim had expressed a desire to see my\n",
      "cousin. My father wished her not to go but said that he left it to her own\n",
      "judgment and feelings to decide. “Yes,” said Elizabeth,\n",
      "“I will go, although she is guilty; and you, Victor, shall accompany\n",
      "me; I cannot go alone.” The idea of this visit was torture to me, yet\n",
      "I could not refuse.\n",
      "\n",
      "We entered the gloomy prison chamber and beheld Justine sitting on some\n",
      "straw at the farther end; her hands were manacled, and her head rested on\n",
      "her knees. She rose on seeing us enter, and when we were left alone with\n",
      "her, she threw herself at the feet of Elizabeth, weeping bitterly. My\n",
      "cousin wept also.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, Justine!” said she.  “Why did you rob me of my last consolation?\n",
      "I relied on your innocence, and although I was then very wretched, I\n",
      "was not so miserable as I am now.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“And do you also believe that I am so very, very wicked?  Do you also\n",
      "join with my enemies to crush me, to condemn me as a murderer?” Her\n",
      "voice was suffocated with sobs.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Rise, my poor girl,” said Elizabeth; “why do you kneel,\n",
      "if you are innocent? I am not one of your enemies, I believed you\n",
      "guiltless, notwithstanding every evidence, until I heard that you had\n",
      "yourself declared your guilt. That report, you say, is false; and be\n",
      "assured, dear Justine, that nothing can shake my confidence in you for a\n",
      "moment, but your own confession.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I did confess, but I confessed a lie.  I confessed, that I might\n",
      "obtain absolution; but now that falsehood lies heavier at my heart than\n",
      "all my other sins.  The God of heaven forgive me!  Ever since I was\n",
      "condemned, my confessor has besieged me; he threatened and menaced,\n",
      "until I almost began to think that I was the monster that he said I\n",
      "was.  He threatened excommunication and hell fire in my last moments if\n",
      "I continued obdurate.  Dear lady, I had none to support me; all looked\n",
      "on me as a wretch doomed to ignominy and perdition.  What could I do?\n",
      "In an evil hour I subscribed to a lie; and now only am I truly\n",
      "miserable.”\n",
      "\n",
      "She paused, weeping, and then continued, “I thought with horror, my\n",
      "sweet lady, that you should believe your Justine, whom your blessed\n",
      "aunt had so highly honoured, and whom you loved, was a creature capable\n",
      "of a crime which none but the devil himself could have perpetrated.\n",
      "Dear William! dearest blessed child!  I soon shall see you again in\n",
      "heaven, where we shall all be happy; and that consoles me, going as I\n",
      "am to suffer ignominy and death.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, Justine!  Forgive me for having for one moment distrusted you.\n",
      "Why did you confess?  But do not mourn, dear girl.  Do not fear.  I\n",
      "will proclaim, I will prove your innocence.  I will melt the stony\n",
      "hearts of your enemies by my tears and prayers.  You shall not die!\n",
      "You, my playfellow, my companion, my sister, perish on the scaffold!\n",
      "No!  No!  I never could survive so horrible a misfortune.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Justine shook her head mournfully.  “I do not fear to die,” she said;\n",
      "“that pang is past.  God raises my weakness and gives me courage to\n",
      "endure the worst.  I leave a sad and bitter world; and if you remember\n",
      "me and think of me as of one unjustly condemned, I am resigned to the\n",
      "fate awaiting me.  Learn from me, dear lady, to submit in patience to\n",
      "the will of heaven!”\n",
      "\n",
      "During this conversation I had retired to a corner of the prison room,\n",
      "where I could conceal the horrid anguish that possessed me.  Despair!\n",
      "Who dared talk of that?  The poor victim, who on the morrow was to pass\n",
      "the awful boundary between life and death, felt not, as I did, such\n",
      "deep and bitter agony.  I gnashed my teeth and ground them together,\n",
      "uttering a groan that came from my inmost soul.  Justine started.  When\n",
      "she saw who it was, she approached me and said, “Dear sir, you are very\n",
      "kind to visit me; you, I hope, do not believe that I am guilty?”\n",
      "\n",
      "I could not answer.  “No, Justine,” said Elizabeth; “he is more\n",
      "convinced of your innocence than I was, for even when he heard that you\n",
      "had confessed, he did not credit it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I truly thank him.  In these last moments I feel the sincerest\n",
      "gratitude towards those who think of me with kindness.  How sweet is\n",
      "the affection of others to such a wretch as I am!  It removes more than\n",
      "half my misfortune, and I feel as if I could die in peace now that my\n",
      "innocence is acknowledged by you, dear lady, and your cousin.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus the poor sufferer tried to comfort others and herself.  She indeed\n",
      "gained the resignation she desired.  But I, the true murderer, felt the\n",
      "never-dying worm alive in my bosom, which allowed of no hope or\n",
      "consolation.  Elizabeth also wept and was unhappy, but hers also was\n",
      "the misery of innocence, which, like a cloud that passes over the fair\n",
      "moon, for a while hides but cannot tarnish its brightness.  Anguish and\n",
      "despair had penetrated into the core of my heart; I bore a hell within\n",
      "me which nothing could extinguish.  We stayed several hours with\n",
      "Justine, and it was with great difficulty that Elizabeth could tear\n",
      "herself away.  “I wish,” cried she, “that I were to die with you; I\n",
      "cannot live in this world of misery.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Justine assumed an air of cheerfulness, while she with difficulty\n",
      "repressed her bitter tears.  She embraced Elizabeth and said in a voice\n",
      "of half-suppressed emotion, “Farewell, sweet lady, dearest Elizabeth,\n",
      "my beloved and only friend; may heaven, in its bounty, bless and\n",
      "preserve you; may this be the last misfortune that you will ever\n",
      "suffer!  Live, and be happy, and make others so.”\n",
      "\n",
      "And on the morrow Justine died.  Elizabeth’s heart-rending eloquence\n",
      "failed to move the judges from their settled conviction in the\n",
      "criminality of the saintly sufferer.  My passionate and indignant\n",
      "appeals were lost upon them.  And when I received their cold answers\n",
      "and heard the harsh, unfeeling reasoning of these men, my purposed\n",
      "avowal died away on my lips.  Thus I might proclaim myself a madman,\n",
      "but not revoke the sentence passed upon my wretched victim.  She\n",
      "perished on the scaffold as a murderess!\n",
      "\n",
      "From the tortures of my own heart, I turned to contemplate the deep and\n",
      "voiceless grief of my Elizabeth.  This also was my doing!  And my\n",
      "father’s woe, and the desolation of that late so smiling home all was\n",
      "the work of my thrice-accursed hands!  Ye weep, unhappy ones, but these\n",
      "are not your last tears!  Again shall you raise the funeral wail, and\n",
      "the sound of your lamentations shall again and again be heard!\n",
      "Frankenstein, your son, your kinsman, your early, much-loved friend; he\n",
      "who would spend each vital drop of blood for your sakes, who has no\n",
      "thought nor sense of joy except as it is mirrored also in your dear\n",
      "countenances, who would fill the air with blessings and spend his life\n",
      "in serving you—he bids you weep, to shed countless tears; happy beyond\n",

      "pause before the peace of the grave have succeeded to your sad torments!\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus spoke my prophetic soul, as, torn by remorse, horror, and despair,\n",

      "I performed the first part of my journey on horseback.  I afterwards\n",

      "middle of the month of August, nearly two months after the death of\n",
      "Justine, that miserable epoch from which I dated all my woe.  The\n",
      "weight upon my spirit was sensibly lightened as I plunged yet deeper in\n",

      "me on every side, the sound of the river raging among the rocks, and\n",
      "the dashing of the waterfalls around spoke of a power mighty as\n",
      "Omnipotence—and I ceased to fear or to bend before any being less\n",
      "almighty than that which had created and ruled the elements, here\n",
      "displayed in their most terrific guise.  Still, as I ascended higher,\n",
      "the valley assumed a more magnificent and astonishing character.\n",
      "Ruined castles hanging on the precipices of piny mountains, the\n",
      "impetuous Arve, and cottages every here and there peeping forth from\n",

      "augmented and rendered sublime by the mighty Alps, whose white and\n",
      "shining pyramids and domes towered above all, as belonging to another\n",

      "I passed the bridge of Pélissier, where the ravine, which the river\n",

      "overhangs it.  Soon after, I entered the valley of Chamounix.  This\n",
      "valley is more wonderful and sublime, but not so beautiful and\n",
      "picturesque as that of Servox, through which I had just passed.  The\n",
      "high and snowy mountains were its immediate boundaries, but I saw no\n",
      "more ruined castles and fertile fields.  Immense glaciers approached\n",
      "the road; I heard the rumbling thunder of the falling avalanche and\n",
      "marked the smoke of its passage.  Mont Blanc, the supreme and\n",
      "magnificent Mont Blanc, raised itself from the surrounding _aiguilles_,\n",
      "and its tremendous _dôme_ overlooked the valley.\n",
      "\n",
      "A tingling long-lost sense of pleasure often came across me during this\n",

      "recognised, reminded me of days gone by, and were associated with the\n",
      "lighthearted gaiety of boyhood.  The very winds whispered in soothing\n",
      "accents, and maternal Nature bade me weep no more.  Then again the\n",
      "kindly influence ceased to act—I found myself fettered again to grief\n",
      "and indulging in all the misery of reflection.  Then I spurred on my\n",
      "animal, striving so to forget the world, my fears, and more than all,\n",
      "myself—or, in a more desperate fashion, I alighted and threw myself on\n",

      "lightnings that played above Mont Blanc and listening to the rushing of\n",
      "the Arve, which pursued its noisy way beneath.  The same lulling sounds\n",
      "acted as a lullaby to my too keen sensations; when I placed my head\n",

      "scattered around; and the solemn silence of this glorious\n",
      "presence-chamber of imperial Nature was broken only by the brawling\n",
      "waves or the fall of some vast fragment, the thunder sound of the\n",
      "avalanche or the cracking, reverberated along the mountains, of the\n",
      "accumulated ice, which, through the silent working of immutable laws,\n",
      "was ever and anon rent and torn, as if it had been but a plaything in\n",
      "their hands.  These sublime and magnificent scenes afforded me the\n",
      "greatest consolation that I was capable of receiving.  They elevated me\n",
      "from all littleness of feeling, and although they did not remove my\n",
      "grief, they subdued and tranquillised it.  In some degree, also, they\n",
      "diverted my mind from the thoughts over which it had brooded for the\n",
      "last month.  I retired to rest at night; my slumbers, as it were,\n",
      "waited on and ministered to by the assemblance of grand shapes which I\n",
      "had contemplated during the day.  They congregated round me; the\n",
      "unstained snowy mountain-top, the glittering pinnacle, the pine woods,\n",
      "and ragged bare ravine, the eagle, soaring amidst the clouds—they all\n",
      "gathered round me and bade me be at peace.\n",

      "Where had they fled when the next morning I awoke?  All of\n",
      "soul-inspiriting fled with sleep, and dark melancholy clouded every\n",
      "thought.  The rain was pouring in torrents, and thick mists hid the\n",
      "summits of the mountains, so that I even saw not the faces of those\n",
      "mighty friends.  Still I would penetrate their misty veil and seek them\n",
      "in their cloudy retreats.  What were rain and storm to me?  My mule was\n",
      "brought to the door, and I resolved to ascend to the summit of\n",
      "Montanvert.  I remembered the effect that the view of the tremendous\n",
      "and ever-moving glacier had produced upon my mind when I first saw it.\n",
      "It had then filled me with a sublime ecstasy that gave wings to the\n",
      "soul and allowed it to soar from the obscure world to light and joy.\n",
      "The sight of the awful and majestic in nature had indeed always the\n",
      "effect of solemnising my mind and causing me to forget the passing\n",
      "cares of life.  I determined to go without a guide, for I was well\n",
      "acquainted with the path, and the presence of another would destroy the\n",
      "solitary grandeur of the scene.\n",
      "\n",
      "The ascent is precipitous, but the path is cut into continual and short\n",
      "windings, which enable you to surmount the perpendicularity of the\n",
      "mountain.  It is a scene terrifically desolate.  In a thousand spots\n",
      "the traces of the winter avalanche may be perceived, where trees lie\n",
      "broken and strewed on the ground, some entirely destroyed, others bent,\n",
      "leaning upon the jutting rocks of the mountain or transversely upon\n",
      "other trees.  The path, as you ascend higher, is intersected by ravines\n",
      "of snow, down which stones continually roll from above; one of them is\n",
      "particularly dangerous, as the slightest sound, such as even speaking\n",
      "in a loud voice, produces a concussion of air sufficient to draw\n",
      "destruction upon the head of the speaker.  The pines are not tall or\n",
      "luxuriant, but they are sombre and add an air of severity to the scene.\n",
      "I looked on the valley beneath; vast mists were rising from the rivers\n",
      "which ran through it and curling in thick wreaths around the opposite\n",
      "mountains, whose summits were hid in the uniform clouds, while rain\n",
      "poured from the dark sky and added to the melancholy impression I\n",
      "received from the objects around me.  Alas!  Why does man boast of\n",
      "sensibilities superior to those apparent in the brute; it only renders\n",
      "them more necessary beings.  If our impulses were confined to hunger,\n",

      "uneven, rising like the waves of a troubled sea, descending low, and\n",
      "interspersed by rifts that sink deep.  The field of ice is almost a\n",
      "league in width, but I spent nearly two hours in crossing it.  The\n",
      "opposite mountain is a bare perpendicular rock.  From the side where I\n",

      "of the rock, gazing on this wonderful and stupendous scene.  The sea,\n",
      "or rather the vast river of ice, wound among its dependent mountains,\n",
      "whose aerial summits hung over its recesses.  Their icy and glittering\n",
      "peaks shone in the sunlight over the clouds.  My heart, which was\n",
      "before sorrowful, now swelled with something like joy; I exclaimed,\n",
      "“Wandering spirits, if indeed ye wander, and do not rest in your narrow\n",

      "stature, also, as he approached, seemed to exceed that of man.  I was\n",
      "troubled; a mist came over my eyes, and I felt a faintness seize me,\n",

      "perceived, as the shape came nearer (sight tremendous and abhorred!)\n",
      "that it was the wretch whom I had created.  I trembled with rage and\n",
      "horror, resolving to wait his approach and then close with him in\n",

      "combined with disdain and malignity, while its unearthly ugliness\n",
      "rendered it almost too horrible for human eyes.  But I scarcely\n",

      "I found this, I resolved to quit the place that I had hitherto\n",
      "inhabited, to seek for one where the few wants I experienced would be\n",

      "to reproduce it.  I gave several hours to the serious consideration of\n",
      "this difficulty, but I was obliged to relinquish all attempt to supply\n",

      "damp substance that covered the ground.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It was about seven in the morning, and I longed to obtain food and\n",

      "had doubtless been built for the convenience of some shepherd.  This\n",
      "was a new sight to me, and I examined the structure with great\n",
      "curiosity.  Finding the door open, I entered.  An old man sat in it,\n",
      "near a fire, over which he was preparing his breakfast.  He turned on\n",
      "hearing a noise, and perceiving me, shrieked loudly, and quitting the\n",
      "hut, ran across the fields with a speed of which his debilitated form\n",
      "hardly appeared capable.  His appearance, different from any I had ever\n",
      "before seen, and his flight somewhat surprised me.  But I was enchanted\n",
      "by the appearance of the hut; here the snow and rain could not\n",
      "penetrate; the ground was dry; and it presented to me then as exquisite\n",
      "and divine a retreat as Pandæmonium appeared to the dæmons of hell\n",
      "after their sufferings in the lake of fire.  I greedily devoured the\n",
      "remnants of the shepherd’s breakfast, which consisted of bread, cheese,\n",
      "milk, and wine; the latter, however, I did not like.  Then, overcome by\n",
      "fatigue, I lay down among some straw and fell asleep.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It was noon when I awoke, and allured by the warmth of the sun, which\n",
      "shone brightly on the white ground, I determined to recommence my\n",
      "travels; and, depositing the remains of the peasant’s breakfast in a\n",
      "wallet I found, I proceeded across the fields for several hours, until\n",
      "at sunset I arrived at a village.  How miraculous did this appear!  The\n",
      "huts, the neater cottages, and stately houses engaged my admiration by\n",
      "turns.  The vegetables in the gardens, the milk and cheese that I saw\n",
      "placed at the windows of some of the cottages, allured my appetite. One\n",
      "of the best of these I entered, but I had hardly placed my foot within\n",
      "the door before the children shrieked, and one of the women fainted.\n",
      "The whole village was roused; some fled, some attacked me, until,\n",
      "grievously bruised by stones and many other kinds of missile weapons, I\n",
      "escaped to the open country and fearfully took refuge in a low hovel,\n",
      "quite bare, and making a wretched appearance after the palaces I had\n",
      "beheld in the village.  This hovel however, joined a cottage of a neat\n",
      "and pleasant appearance, but after my late dearly bought experience, I\n",
      "dared not enter it.  My place of refuge was constructed of wood, but so\n",
      "low that I could with difficulty sit upright in it.  No wood, however,\n",
      "was placed on the earth, which formed the floor, but it was dry; and\n",
      "although the wind entered it by innumerable chinks, I found it an\n",
      "agreeable asylum from the snow and rain.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Here, then, I retreated and lay down happy to have found a shelter,\n",
      "however miserable, from the inclemency of the season, and still more\n",
      "from the barbarity of man.  As soon as morning dawned I crept from my\n",
      "kennel, that I might view the adjacent cottage and discover if I could\n",
      "remain in the habitation I had found.  It was situated against the back\n",
      "of the cottage and surrounded on the sides which were exposed by a pig\n",
      "sty and a clear pool of water.  One part was open, and by that I had\n",
      "crept in; but now I covered every crevice by which I might be perceived\n",
      "with stones and wood, yet in such a manner that I might move them on\n",
      "occasion to pass out; all the light I enjoyed came through the sty, and\n",
      "that was sufficient for me.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Having thus arranged my dwelling and carpeted it with clean straw, I\n",
      "retired, for I saw the figure of a man at a distance, and I remembered\n",
      "too well my treatment the night before to trust myself in his power.  I\n",
      "had first, however, provided for my sustenance for that day by a loaf\n",
      "of coarse bread, which I purloined, and a cup with which I could drink\n",
      "more conveniently than from my hand of the pure water which flowed by\n",
      "my retreat.  The floor was a little raised, so that it was kept\n",
      "perfectly dry, and by its vicinity to the chimney of the cottage it was\n",
      "tolerably warm.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Being thus provided, I resolved to reside in this hovel until\n",
      "something should occur which might alter my determination.  It was\n",
      "indeed a paradise compared to the bleak forest, my former residence,\n",
      "the rain-dropping branches, and dank earth.  I ate my breakfast with\n",
      "pleasure and was about to remove a plank to procure myself a little\n",
      "water when I heard a step, and looking through a small chink, I beheld\n",
      "a young creature, with a pail on her head, passing before my hovel. The\n",
      "girl was young and of gentle demeanour, unlike what I have since found\n",
      "cottagers and farmhouse servants to be.  Yet she was meanly dressed, a\n",
      "coarse blue petticoat and a linen jacket being her only garb; her fair\n",
      "hair was plaited but not adorned:  she looked patient yet sad.  I lost\n",
      "sight of her, and in about a quarter of an hour she returned bearing\n",
      "the pail, which was now partly filled with milk.  As she walked along,\n",
      "seemingly incommoded by the burden, a young man met her, whose\n",
      "countenance expressed a deeper despondence.  Uttering a few sounds with\n",
      "an air of melancholy, he took the pail from her head and bore it to the\n",
      "cottage himself.  She followed, and they disappeared.  Presently I saw\n",
      "the young man again, with some tools in his hand, cross the field\n",
      "behind the cottage; and the girl was also busied, sometimes in the\n",
      "house and sometimes in the yard.\n",
      "\n",
      "“On examining my dwelling, I found that one of the windows of the\n",
      "cottage had formerly occupied a part of it, but the panes had been\n",
      "filled up with wood. In one of these was a small and almost\n",
      "imperceptible chink through which the eye could just penetrate.\n",
      "Through this crevice a small room was visible, whitewashed and clean\n",
      "but very bare of furniture. In one corner, near a small fire, sat an\n",
      "old man, leaning his head on his hands in a disconsolate attitude. The\n",
      "young girl was occupied in arranging the cottage; but presently she\n",
      "took something out of a drawer, which employed her hands, and she sat\n",
      "down beside the old man, who, taking up an instrument, began to play\n",
      "and to produce sounds sweeter than the voice of the thrush or the\n",
      "nightingale. It was a lovely sight, even to me, poor wretch who had\n",
      "never beheld aught beautiful before. The silver hair and benevolent\n",
      "countenance of the aged cottager won my reverence, while the gentle\n",
      "manners of the girl enticed my love. He played a sweet mournful air\n",
      "which I perceived drew tears from the eyes of his amiable companion, of\n",
      "which the old man took no notice, until she sobbed audibly; he then\n",
      "pronounced a few sounds, and the fair creature, leaving her work, knelt\n",
      "at his feet. He raised her and smiled with such kindness and affection\n",
      "that I felt sensations of a peculiar and overpowering nature; they were\n",
      "a mixture of pain and pleasure, such as I had never before experienced,\n",
      "either from hunger or cold, warmth or food; and I withdrew from the\n",
      "window, unable to bear these emotions.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Soon after this the young man returned, bearing on his shoulders a\n",
      "load of wood.  The girl met him at the door, helped to relieve him of\n",
      "his burden, and taking some of the fuel into the cottage, placed it on\n",
      "the fire; then she and the youth went apart into a nook of the cottage,\n",
      "and he showed her a large loaf and a piece of cheese.  She seemed\n",
      "pleased and went into the garden for some roots and plants, which she\n",
      "placed in water, and then upon the fire.  She afterwards continued her\n",
      "work, whilst the young man went into the garden and appeared busily\n",
      "employed in digging and pulling up roots.  After he had been employed\n",
      "thus about an hour, the young woman joined him and they entered the\n",
      "cottage together.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The old man had, in the meantime, been pensive, but on the appearance\n",
      "of his companions he assumed a more cheerful air, and they sat down to\n",
      "eat.  The meal was quickly dispatched.  The young woman was again\n",
      "occupied in arranging the cottage, the old man walked before the\n",
      "cottage in the sun for a few minutes, leaning on the arm of the youth.\n",
      "Nothing could exceed in beauty the contrast between these two excellent\n",
      "creatures.  One was old, with silver hairs and a countenance beaming\n",
      "with benevolence and love; the younger was slight and graceful in his\n",
      "figure, and his features were moulded with the finest symmetry, yet his\n",
      "eyes and attitude expressed the utmost sadness and despondency.  The\n",

      "instrument which produced the divine sounds that had enchanted me in\n",

      "but to utter sounds that were monotonous, and neither resembling the\n",
      "harmony of the old man’s instrument nor the songs of the birds; I since\n",

      "except in very rare instances, as a vagabond and a slave, doomed to\n",

      "nature of Safie was outraged by this command; she attempted to\n",

      "to it.  By some papers of her father which fell into her hands she\n",
      "heard of the exile of her lover and learnt the name of the spot where\n",

      "employed in their ordinary occupations.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I can hardly describe to you the effect of these books.  They produced\n",
      "in me an infinity of new images and feelings, that sometimes raised me\n",
      "to ecstasy, but more frequently sunk me into the lowest dejection.  In\n",
      "the _Sorrows of Werter_, besides the interest of its simple and affecting\n",
      "story, so many opinions are canvassed and so many lights thrown upon\n",
      "what had hitherto been to me obscure subjects that I found in it a\n",
      "never-ending source of speculation and astonishment.  The gentle and\n",

      "feelings, which had for their object something out of self, accorded\n",
      "well with my experience among my protectors and with the wants which\n",
      "were for ever alive in my own bosom.  But I thought Werter himself a\n",
      "more divine being than I had ever beheld or imagined; his character\n",
      "contained no pretension, but it sank deep.  The disquisitions upon\n",
      "death and suicide were calculated to fill  me with wonder.  I did not\n",
      "pretend to enter into the merits of the case, yet I inclined towards\n",

      "unlike to the beings concerning whom I read and to whose conversation I\n",
      "was a listener.  I sympathised with and partly understood them, but I\n",
      "was unformed in mind; I was dependent on none and related to none.\n",
      "‘The path of my departure was free,’ and there was none to lament my\n",
      "annihilation.  My person was hideous and my stature gigantic.  What did\n",

      "\n",
      "“The volume of _Plutarch’s Lives_ which I possessed contained the\n",
      "histories of the first founders of the ancient republics.  This book\n",
      "had a far different effect upon me from the _Sorrows of Werter_.  I\n",
      "learned from Werter’s imaginations despondency and gloom, but Plutarch\n",
      "taught me high thoughts; he elevated me above the wretched sphere of my\n",
      "own reflections, to admire and love the heroes of past ages.  Many\n",
      "things I read surpassed my understanding and experience.  I had a very\n",
      "confused knowledge of kingdoms, wide extents of country, mighty rivers,\n",
      "and boundless seas.  But I was perfectly unacquainted with towns and\n",
      "large assemblages of men. The cottage of my protectors had been the\n",
      "only school in which I had studied human nature, but this book\n",
      "developed new and mightier scenes of action.  I read of men concerned\n",
      "in public affairs, governing or massacring their species.  I felt the\n",
      "greatest ardour for virtue rise within me, and abhorrence for vice, as\n",
      "far as I understood the signification of those terms, relative as they\n",
      "were, as I applied them, to pleasure and pain alone.  Induced by these\n",
      "feelings, I was of course led to admire peaceable lawgivers, Numa,\n",
      "Solon, and Lycurgus, in preference to Romulus and Theseus.  The\n",

      "picture of an omnipotent God warring with his creatures was capable of\n",
      "exciting.  I often referred the several situations, as their similarity\n",

      "in every other respect.  He had come forth from the hands of God a\n",
      "perfect creature, happy and prosperous, guarded by the especial care of\n",
      "his Creator; he was allowed to converse with and acquire knowledge from\n",
      "beings of a superior nature, but I was wretched, helpless, and alone.\n",

      "your journal of the four months that preceded my creation.  You\n",
      "minutely described in these papers every step you took in the progress\n",
      "of your work; this history was mingled with accounts of domestic\n",
      "occurrences.  You doubtless recollect these papers.  Here they are.\n",
      "Everything is related in them which bears reference to my accursed\n",
      "origin; the whole detail of that series of disgusting circumstances\n",

      "to fit myself for an interview with them which would decide my fate.  I\n",
      "postponed this attempt for some months longer, for the importance\n",
      "attached to its success inspired me with a dread lest I should fail.\n",
      "Besides, I found that my understanding improved so much with every\n",

      "spurned and deserted me, anger returned, a rage of anger, and unable to\n",
      "injure anything human, I turned my fury towards inanimate objects.  As\n",
      "night advanced, I placed a variety of combustibles around the cottage,\n",

      "and bushes, which I had collected.  The wind fanned the fire, and the\n",

      "thought of you crossed my mind.  I learned from your papers that you\n",

      "But on you only had I any claim for pity and redress, and from you I\n",

      "mildness of my nature had fled, and all within me was turned to gall\n",
      "and bitterness.  The nearer I approached to your habitation, the more\n",
      "deeply did I feel the spirit of revenge enkindled in my heart.  Snow\n",
      "fell, and the waters were hardened, but I rested not.  A few incidents\n",
      "now and then directed me, and I possessed a map of the country; but I\n",
      "often wandered wide from my path.  The agony of my feelings allowed me\n",

      "kindness and gentleness which I had entertained but a few moments\n",
      "before gave place to hellish rage and gnashing of teeth.  Inflamed by\n",

      "We stayed a day at Mannheim, and on the fifth from our departure from\n",

      "many ruined castles standing on the edges of precipices, surrounded by\n",
      "black woods, high and inaccessible.  This part of the Rhine, indeed,\n",

      "continually agitated by gloomy feelings, even I was pleased. I lay at the\n",
      "bottom of the boat, and as I gazed on the cloudless blue sky, I seemed to\n",
      "drink in a tranquillity to which I had long been a stranger. And if these\n",
      "were my sensations, who can describe those of Henry? He felt as if he had\n",
      "been transported to Fairy-land and enjoyed a happiness seldom tasted by\n",
      "man. “I have seen,” he said, “the most beautiful scenes\n",
      "of my own country; I have visited the lakes of Lucerne and Uri, where the\n",

      "and impenetrable shades, which would cause a gloomy and mournful appearance\n",

      "where the priest and his mistress were overwhelmed by an avalanche and\n",
      "where their dying voices are still said to be heard amid the pauses of the\n",

      "taken of its society, the means of materially assisting the progress of\n",
      "European colonization and trade.  In Britain only could he further the\n",
      "execution of his plan.  He was for ever busy, and the only check to his\n",

      "as much as possible, that I might not debar him from the pleasures\n",
      "natural to one who was entering on a new scene of life, undisturbed by\n",

      "We had arrived in England at the beginning of October, and it was now\n",

      "Matlock, and the Cumberland lakes, resolving to arrive at the completion of\n",
      "this tour about the end of July. I packed up my chemical instruments and\n",

      "son, gave a peculiar interest to every part of the city which they\n",
      "might be supposed to have inhabited.  The spirit of elder days found a\n",
      "dwelling here, and we delighted to trace its footsteps.  If these\n",
      "feelings had not found an imaginary gratification, the appearance of\n",
      "the city had yet in itself sufficient beauty to obtain our admiration.\n",
      "The colleges are ancient and picturesque; the streets are almost\n",
      "magnificent; and the lovely Isis, which flows beside it through meadows\n",
      "of exquisite verdure, is spread forth into a placid expanse of waters,\n",
      "which reflects its majestic assemblage of towers, and spires, and\n",

      "\n",
      "I enjoyed this scene, and yet my enjoyment was embittered both by the\n",
      "memory of the past and the anticipation of the future.  I was formed\n",
      "for peaceful happiness.  During my youthful days discontent never\n",
      "visited my mind, and if I was ever overcome by _ennui_, the sight of what\n",
      "is beautiful in nature or the study of what is excellent and sublime in\n",
      "the productions of man could always interest my heart and communicate\n",
      "elasticity to my spirits.  But I am a blasted tree; the bolt has\n",
      "entered my soul; and I felt then that I should survive to exhibit what\n",
      "I shall soon cease to be—a miserable spectacle of wrecked humanity,\n",
      "pitiable to others and intolerable to myself.\n",

      "We passed a considerable period at Oxford, rambling among its environs\n",
      "and endeavouring to identify every spot which might relate to the most\n",
      "animating epoch of English history.  Our little voyages of discovery\n",
      "were often prolonged by the successive objects that presented\n",
      "themselves.  We visited the tomb of the illustrious Hampden and the\n",
      "field on which that patriot fell.  For a moment my soul was elevated\n",
      "from its debasing and miserable fears to contemplate the divine ideas\n",
      "of liberty and self-sacrifice of which these sights were the monuments\n",
      "and the remembrancers.  For an instant I dared to shake off my chains\n",
      "and look around me with a free and lofty spirit, but the iron had eaten\n",

      "resembled, to a greater degree, the scenery of Switzerland; but\n",
      "everything is on a lower scale, and the green hills want the crown of\n",
      "distant white Alps which always attend on the piny mountains of my\n",
      "native country.  We visited the wondrous cave and the little cabinets\n",
      "of natural history, where the curiosities are disposed in the same\n",
      "manner as in the collections at Servox and Chamounix.  The latter name\n",
      "made me tremble when pronounced by Henry, and I hastened to quit\n",
      "Matlock, with which that terrible scene was thus associated.\n",
      "\n",
      "From Derby, still journeying northwards, we passed two months in\n",
      "Cumberland and Westmorland.  I could now almost fancy myself among the\n",
      "Swiss mountains.  The little patches of snow which yet lingered on the\n",
      "northern sides of the mountains, the lakes, and the dashing of the\n",
      "rocky streams were all familiar and dear sights to me.  Here also we\n",
      "made some acquaintances, who almost contrived to cheat me into\n",
      "happiness.  The delight of Clerval was proportionably greater than\n",
      "mine; his mind expanded in the company of men of talent, and he found\n",
      "in his own nature greater capacities and resources than he could have\n",
      "imagined himself to have possessed while he associated with his\n",
      "inferiors.  “I could pass my life here,” said he to me; “and among\n",
      "these mountains I should scarcely regret Switzerland and the Rhine.”\n",
      "\n",
      "But he found that a traveller’s life is one that includes much pain\n",
      "amidst its enjoyments.  His feelings are for ever on the stretch; and\n",
      "when he begins to sink into repose, he finds himself obliged to quit\n",
      "that on which he rests in pleasure for something new, which again\n",
      "engages his attention, and which also he forsakes for other novelties.\n",
      "\n",
      "We had scarcely visited the various lakes of Cumberland and Westmorland\n",
      "and conceived an affection for some of the inhabitants when the period\n",
      "of our appointment with our Scotch friend approached, and we left them\n",
      "to travel on.  For my own part I was not sorry.  I had now neglected my\n",
      "promise for some time, and I feared the effects of the dæmon’s\n",
      "disappointment.  He might remain in Switzerland and wreak his vengeance\n",
      "on my relatives.  This idea pursued me and tormented me at every moment\n",
      "from which I might otherwise have snatched repose and peace.  I waited\n",
      "for my letters with feverish impatience; if they were delayed I was\n",
      "miserable and overcome by a thousand fears; and when they arrived and I\n",
      "saw the superscription of Elizabeth or my father, I hardly dared to\n",
      "read and ascertain my fate.  Sometimes I thought that the fiend\n",
      "followed me and might expedite my remissness by murdering my companion.\n",
      "When these thoughts possessed me, I would not quit Henry for a moment,\n",
      "but followed him as his shadow, to protect him from the fancied rage of\n",
      "his destroyer.  I felt as if I had committed some great crime, the\n",
      "consciousness of which haunted me.  I was guiltless, but I had indeed\n",
      "drawn down a horrible curse upon my head, as mortal as that of crime.\n",
      "\n",
      "I visited Edinburgh with languid eyes and mind; and yet that city might\n",
      "have interested the most unfortunate being. Clerval did not like it so well\n",
      "as Oxford, for the antiquity of the latter city was more pleasing to him.\n",
      "But the beauty and regularity of the new town of Edinburgh, its romantic\n",
      "castle and its environs, the most delightful in the world, Arthur’s\n",
      "Seat, St. Bernard’s Well, and the Pentland Hills, compensated him for\n",
      "the change and filled him with cheerfulness and admiration. But I was\n",
      "impatient to arrive at the termination of my journey.\n",
      "\n",
      "We left Edinburgh in a week, passing through Coupar, St. Andrew’s, and\n",
      "along the banks of the Tay, to Perth, where our friend expected us.\n",
      "But I was in no mood to laugh and talk with strangers or enter into\n",
      "their feelings or plans with the good humour expected from a guest; and\n",
      "accordingly I told Clerval that I wished to make the tour of Scotland\n",
      "alone.  “Do you,” said I, “enjoy yourself, and let this be our\n",
      "rendezvous.  I may be absent a month or two; but do not interfere with\n",
      "my motions, I entreat you; leave me to peace and solitude for a short\n",
      "time; and when I return, I hope it will be with a lighter heart, more\n",
      "congenial to your own temper.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Henry wished to dissuade me, but seeing me bent on this plan, ceased to\n",
      "remonstrate.  He entreated me to write often.  “I had rather be with\n",
      "you,” he said, “in your solitary rambles, than with these Scotch\n",
      "people, whom I do not know; hasten, then, my dear  friend, to return,\n",

      "your absence.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Having parted from my friend, I determined to visit some remote spot of\n",

      "finished, that he might receive his companion.\n",
      "\n",
      "With this resolution I traversed the northern highlands and fixed on one of\n",

      "fitted for such a work, being hardly more than a rock whose high sides were\n",
      "continually beaten upon by the waves. The soil was barren, scarcely\n",
      "affording pasture for a few miserable cows, and oatmeal for its\n",
      "inhabitants, which consisted of five persons, whose gaunt and scraggy limbs\n",
      "gave tokens of their miserable fare. Vegetables and bread, when they\n",
      "indulged in such luxuries, and even fresh water, was to be procured from\n",
      "the mainland, which was about five miles distant.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the whole island there were but three miserable huts, and one of\n",
      "these was vacant when I arrived.  This I hired.  It contained but two\n",
      "rooms, and these exhibited all the squalidness of the most miserable\n",
      "penury.  The thatch had fallen in, the walls were unplastered, and the\n",
      "door was off its hinges.  I ordered it to be repaired, bought some\n",
      "furniture, and took possession, an incident which would doubtless have\n",
      "occasioned some surprise had not all the senses of the cottagers been\n",
      "benumbed by want and squalid poverty.  As it was, I lived ungazed at\n",
      "and unmolested, hardly thanked for the pittance of food and clothes\n",
      "which I gave, so much does suffering blunt even the coarsest sensations\n",

      "monotonous yet ever-changing scene.  I thought of Switzerland; it was\n",
      "far different from this desolate and appalling landscape.  Its hills\n",
      "are covered with vines, and its cottages are scattered thickly in the\n",
      "plains.  Its fair lakes reflect a blue and gentle sky, and when\n",

      "laboratory for several days, and at other times I toiled day and night\n",
      "in order to complete my work.  It was, indeed, a filthy process in\n",
      "which I was engaged.  During my first experiment, a kind of\n",

      "mind was intently fixed on the consummation of my labour, and my eyes\n",

      "fishing-boat land close to me, and one of the men brought me a packet;\n",
      "it contained letters from Geneva, and one from Clerval entreating me to\n",

      "he was, that letters from the friends he had formed in London desired\n",

      "clearly.  The idea of renewing my labours did not for one instant occur\n",
      "to me; the threat I had heard weighed on my thoughts, but I did not\n",
      "reflect that a voluntary act of mine could avert it.  I had resolved in\n",
      "my own mind that to create another like the fiend I had first made\n",
      "would be an act of the basest and most atrocious selfishness, and I\n",
      "banished from my mind every thought that could lead to a different\n",
      "conclusion.\n",
      "\n",
      "Between two and three in the morning the moon rose; and I then, putting my\n",
      "basket aboard a little skiff, sailed out about four miles from the shore.\n",
      "The scene was perfectly solitary; a few boats were returning towards land,\n",
      "but I sailed away from them. I felt as if I was about the commission of a\n",
      "dreadful crime and avoided with shuddering anxiety any encounter with my\n",
      "fellow creatures. At one time the moon, which had before been clear, was\n",
      "suddenly overspread by a thick cloud, and I took advantage of the moment of\n",
      "darkness and cast my basket into the sea; I listened to the gurgling sound\n",
      "as it sank and then sailed away from the spot. The sky became clouded, but\n",
      "the air was pure, although chilled by the northeast breeze that was then\n",
      "rising. But it refreshed me and filled me with such agreeable sensations\n",
      "that I resolved to prolong my stay on the water, and fixing the rudder in a\n",
      "direct position, stretched myself at the bottom of the boat. Clouds hid the\n",
      "moon, everything was obscure, and I heard only the sound of the boat as its\n",
      "keel cut through the waves; the murmur lulled me, and in a short time I\n",
      "slept soundly.\n",
      "\n",
      "I do not know how long I remained in this situation, but when I awoke I\n",
      "found that the sun had already mounted considerably. The wind was high, and\n",
      "the waves continually threatened the safety of my little skiff. I found\n",
      "that the wind was northeast and must have driven me far from the coast from\n",
      "which I had embarked. I endeavoured to change my course but quickly found\n",
      "that if I again made the attempt the boat would be instantly filled with\n",
      "water. Thus situated, my only resource was to drive before the wind. I\n",
      "confess that I felt a few sensations of terror. I had no compass with me\n",
      "and was so slenderly acquainted with the geography of this part of the\n",
      "world that the sun was of little benefit to me. I might be driven into the\n",
      "wide Atlantic and feel all the tortures of starvation or be swallowed up in\n",
      "the immeasurable waters that roared and buffeted around me. I had already\n",
      "been out many hours and felt the torment of a burning thirst, a prelude to\n",
      "my other sufferings. I looked on the heavens, which were covered by clouds\n",
      "that flew before the wind, only to be replaced by others; I looked upon the\n",
      "sea; it was to be my grave. “Fiend,” I exclaimed, “your\n",
      "task is already fulfilled!” I thought of Elizabeth, of my father, and\n",
      "of Clerval—all left behind, on whom the monster might satisfy his\n",
      "sanguinary and merciless passions. This idea plunged me into a reverie so\n",
      "despairing and frightful that even now, when the scene is on the point of\n",
      "closing before me for ever, I shudder to reflect on it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some hours passed thus; but by degrees, as the sun declined towards the\n",
      "horizon, the wind died away into a gentle breeze and the sea became\n",
      "free from breakers.  But these gave place to a heavy swell; I felt sick\n",
      "and hardly able to hold the rudder, when suddenly I saw a line of high\n",
      "land towards the south.\n",
      "\n",
      "Almost spent, as I was, by fatigue and the dreadful suspense I endured\n",
      "for several hours, this sudden certainty of life rushed like a flood of\n",
      "warm joy to my heart, and tears gushed from my eyes.\n",
      "\n",
      "How mutable are our feelings, and how strange is that clinging love we have\n",
      "of life even in the excess of misery! I constructed another sail with a\n",
      "part of my dress and eagerly steered my course towards the land. It had a\n",
      "wild and rocky appearance, but as I approached nearer I easily perceived\n",
      "the traces of cultivation. I saw vessels near the shore and found myself\n",
      "suddenly transported back to the neighbourhood of civilised man. I\n",
      "carefully traced the windings of the land and hailed a steeple which I at\n",
      "length saw issuing from behind a small promontory. As I was in a state of\n",
      "extreme debility, I resolved to sail directly towards the town, as a place\n",
      "where I could most easily procure nourishment. Fortunately I had money with\n",
      "me. As I turned the promontory I perceived a small neat town and a good\n",
      "harbour, which I entered, my heart bounding with joy at my unexpected\n",
      "escape.\n",
      "\n",
      "As I was occupied in fixing the boat and arranging the sails, several\n",
      "people crowded towards the spot.  They seemed much surprised at my\n",
      "appearance, but instead of offering me any assistance, whispered\n",
      "together with gestures that at any other time might have produced in me\n",
      "a slight sensation of alarm. As it was, I merely remarked that they\n",
      "spoke English, and I therefore addressed them in that language.  “My\n",
      "good friends,” said I, “will you be so kind as to tell me the name of\n",
      "this town and inform me where I am?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You will know that soon enough,” replied a man with a hoarse voice.\n",
      "“Maybe you are come to a place that will not prove much to your taste,\n",
      "but you will not be consulted as to your quarters, I promise you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "I was exceedingly surprised on receiving so rude an answer from a\n",
      "stranger, and I was also disconcerted on perceiving the frowning and\n",
      "angry countenances of his companions.  “Why do you answer me so\n",
      "roughly?”  I replied.  “Surely it is not the custom of Englishmen to\n",
      "receive strangers so inhospitably.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I do not know,” said the man, “what the custom of the\n",
      "English may be, but it is the custom of the Irish to hate villains.”\n",
      "\n",
      "While this strange dialogue continued, I perceived the crowd rapidly\n",
      "increase. Their faces expressed a mixture of curiosity and anger, which\n",
      "annoyed and in some degree alarmed me. I inquired the way to the inn, but\n",
      "no one replied. I then moved forward, and a murmuring sound arose from the\n",
      "crowd as they followed and surrounded me, when an ill-looking man\n",
      "approaching tapped me on the shoulder and said, “Come, sir, you must\n",
      "follow me to Mr. Kirwin’s to give an account of yourself.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Who is Mr. Kirwin?  Why am I to give an account of myself?  Is not\n",
      "this a free country?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ay, sir, free enough for honest folks.  Mr. Kirwin is a magistrate,\n",
      "and you are to give an account of the death of a gentleman who was\n",
      "found murdered here last night.”\n",
      "\n",
      "This answer startled me, but I presently recovered myself. I was innocent;\n",
      "that could easily be proved; accordingly I followed my conductor in silence\n",
      "and was led to one of the best houses in the town. I was ready to sink from\n",
      "fatigue and hunger, but being surrounded by a crowd, I thought it politic\n",
      "to rouse all my strength, that no physical debility might be construed into\n",
      "apprehension or conscious guilt. Little did I then expect the calamity that\n",
      "was in a few moments to overwhelm me and extinguish in horror and despair\n",
      "all fear of ignominy or death.\n",
      "\n",
      "I must pause here, for it requires all my fortitude to recall the memory of\n",
      "the frightful events which I am about to relate, in proper detail, to my\n",
      "recollection.\n",

      "\n",
      "I was soon introduced into the presence of the magistrate, an old\n",
      "benevolent man with calm and mild manners.  He looked upon me, however,\n",
      "with some degree of severity, and then, turning towards my conductors,\n",
      "he asked who appeared as witnesses on this occasion.\n",
      "\n",
      "About half a dozen men came forward; and, one being selected by the\n",
      "magistrate, he deposed that he had been out fishing the night before with\n",
      "his son and brother-in-law, Daniel Nugent, when, about ten o’clock,\n",
      "they observed a strong northerly blast rising, and they accordingly put in\n",
      "for port. It was a very dark night, as the moon had not yet risen; they did\n",
      "not land at the harbour, but, as they had been accustomed, at a creek about\n",
      "two miles below. He walked on first, carrying a part of the fishing tackle,\n",
      "and his companions followed him at some distance. As he was proceeding\n",
      "along the sands, he struck his foot against something and fell at his\n",
      "length on the ground. His companions came up to assist him, and by the\n",
      "light of their lantern they found that he had fallen on the body of a man,\n",
      "who was to all appearance dead. Their first supposition was that it was the\n",
      "corpse of some person who had been drowned and was thrown on shore by the\n",
      "waves, but on examination they found that the clothes were not wet and even\n",
      "that the body was not then cold. They instantly carried it to the cottage\n",
      "of an old woman near the spot and endeavoured, but in vain, to restore it\n",
      "to life. It appeared to be a handsome young man, about five and twenty\n",
      "years of age. He had apparently been strangled, for there was no sign of\n",
      "any violence except the black mark of fingers on his neck.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first part of this deposition did not in the least interest me, but\n",
      "when the mark of the fingers was mentioned I remembered the murder of\n",
      "my brother and felt myself extremely agitated; my limbs trembled, and a\n",
      "mist came over my eyes, which obliged me to lean on a chair for\n",
      "support.  The magistrate observed me with a keen eye and of course drew\n",
      "an unfavourable augury from my manner.\n",
      "\n",
      "The son confirmed his father’s account, but when Daniel Nugent was\n",
      "called he swore positively that just before the fall of his companion, he\n",
      "saw a boat, with a single man in it, at a short distance from the shore;\n",
      "and as far as he could judge by the light of a few stars, it was the same\n",
      "boat in which I had just landed.\n",
      "\n",
      "A woman deposed that she lived near the beach and was standing at the door\n",
      "of her cottage, waiting for the return of the fishermen, about an hour\n",
      "before she heard of the discovery of the body, when she saw a boat with\n",
      "only one man in it push off from that part of the shore where the corpse\n",
      "was afterwards found.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another woman confirmed the account of the fishermen having brought the\n",
      "body into her house; it was not cold.  They put it into a bed and\n",
      "rubbed it, and Daniel went to the town for an apothecary, but life was\n",
      "quite gone.\n",
      "\n",
      "Several other men were examined concerning my landing, and they agreed\n",
      "that, with the strong north wind that had arisen during the night, it\n",
      "was very probable that I had beaten about for many hours and had been\n",
      "obliged to return nearly to the same spot from which I had departed.\n",
      "Besides, they observed that it appeared that I had brought the body\n",
      "from another place, and it was likely that as I did not appear to know\n",
      "the shore, I might have put into the harbour ignorant of the distance\n",
      "of the town of —— from the place where I had deposited the corpse.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Kirwin, on hearing this evidence, desired that I should be taken into\n",
      "the room where the body lay for interment, that it might be observed what\n",
      "effect the sight of it would produce upon me. This idea was probably\n",
      "suggested by the extreme agitation I had exhibited when the mode of the\n",
      "murder had been described. I was accordingly conducted, by the magistrate\n",
      "and several other persons, to the inn. I could not help being struck by the\n",
      "strange coincidences that had taken place during this eventful night; but,\n",
      "knowing that I had been conversing with several persons in the island I had\n",
      "inhabited about the time that the body had been found, I was perfectly\n",
      "tranquil as to the consequences of the affair.\n",
      "\n",
      "I entered the room where the corpse lay and was led up to the coffin. How\n",
      "can I describe my sensations on beholding it? I feel yet parched with\n",
      "horror, nor can I reflect on that terrible moment without shuddering and\n",
      "agony. The examination, the presence of the magistrate and witnesses,\n",
      "passed like a dream from my memory when I saw the lifeless form of Henry\n",
      "Clerval stretched before me. I gasped for breath, and throwing myself on\n",
      "the body, I exclaimed, “Have my murderous machinations deprived you\n",
      "also, my dearest Henry, of life? Two I have already destroyed; other\n",
      "victims await their destiny; but you, Clerval, my friend, my\n",
      "benefactor—”\n",
      "\n",
      "The human frame could no longer support the agonies that I endured, and\n",
      "I was carried out of the room in strong convulsions.\n",
      "\n",
      "A fever succeeded to this. I lay for two months on the point of death; my\n",
      "ravings, as I afterwards heard, were frightful; I called myself the\n",
      "murderer of William, of Justine, and of Clerval. Sometimes I entreated my\n",
      "attendants to assist me in the destruction of the fiend by whom I was\n",
      "tormented; and at others I felt the fingers of the monster already grasping\n",
      "my neck, and screamed aloud with agony and terror. Fortunately, as I spoke\n",
      "my native language, Mr. Kirwin alone understood me; but my gestures and\n",
      "bitter cries were sufficient to affright the other witnesses.\n",
      "\n",
      "Why did I not die? More miserable than man ever was before, why did I not\n",
      "sink into forgetfulness and rest? Death snatches away many blooming\n",
      "children, the only hopes of their doting parents; how many brides and\n",
      "youthful lovers have been one day in the bloom of health and hope, and the\n",
      "next a prey for worms and the decay of the tomb! Of what materials was I\n",
      "made that I could thus resist so many shocks, which, like the turning of\n",
      "the wheel, continually renewed the torture?\n",
      "\n",
      "But I was doomed to live and in two months found myself as awaking from\n",
      "a dream, in a prison, stretched on a wretched bed, surrounded by\n",
      "gaolers, turnkeys, bolts, and all the miserable apparatus of a dungeon.\n",
      "It was morning, I remember, when I thus awoke to understanding; I had\n",
      "forgotten the particulars of what had happened and only felt as if some\n",
      "great misfortune had suddenly overwhelmed me; but when I looked around\n",
      "and saw the barred windows and the squalidness of the room in which I\n",
      "was, all flashed across my memory and I groaned bitterly.\n",
      "\n",
      "This sound disturbed an old woman who was sleeping in a chair beside\n",
      "me.  She was a hired nurse, the wife of one of the turnkeys, and her\n",
      "countenance expressed all those bad qualities which often characterise\n",
      "that class.  The lines of her face were hard and rude, like that of\n",
      "persons accustomed to see without sympathising in sights of misery. Her\n",
      "tone expressed her entire indifference; she addressed me in English,\n",
      "and the voice struck me as one that I had heard during my sufferings.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Are you better now, sir?” said she.\n",
      "\n",
      "I replied in the same language, with a feeble voice, “I believe I am;\n",
      "but if it be all true, if indeed I did not dream, I am sorry that I am\n",
      "still alive to feel this misery and horror.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“For that matter,” replied the old woman, “if you mean about the\n",
      "gentleman you murdered, I believe that it were better for you if you\n",
      "were dead, for I fancy it will go hard with you!  However, that’s none\n",
      "of my business; I am sent to nurse you and get you well; I do my duty\n",
      "with a safe conscience; it were well if everybody did the same.”\n",
      "\n",
      "I turned with loathing from the woman who could utter so unfeeling a\n",
      "speech to a person just saved, on the very edge of death; but I felt\n",
      "languid and unable to reflect on all that had passed.  The whole series\n",
      "of my life appeared to me as a dream; I sometimes doubted if indeed it\n",
      "were all true, for it never presented itself to my mind with the force\n",
      "of reality.\n",
      "\n",
      "As the images that floated before me became more distinct, I grew\n",
      "feverish; a darkness pressed around me; no one was near me who soothed\n",
      "me with the gentle voice of love; no dear hand supported me.  The\n",
      "physician came and prescribed medicines, and the old woman prepared\n",
      "them for me; but utter carelessness was visible in the first, and the\n",
      "expression of brutality was strongly marked in the visage of the\n",
      "second.  Who could be interested in the fate of a murderer but the\n",
      "hangman who would gain his fee?\n",
      "\n",
      "These were my first reflections, but I soon learned that Mr. Kirwin had\n",
      "shown me extreme kindness.  He had caused the best room in the prison\n",
      "to be prepared for me (wretched indeed was the best); and it was he who\n",
      "had provided a physician and a nurse.  It is true, he seldom came to\n",
      "see me, for although he ardently desired to relieve the sufferings of\n",
      "every human creature, he did not wish to be present at the agonies and\n",
      "miserable ravings of a murderer.  He came, therefore, sometimes to see\n",
      "that I was not neglected, but his visits were short and with long\n",
      "intervals.\n",
      "\n",
      "One day, while I was gradually recovering, I was seated in a chair, my eyes\n",
      "half open and my cheeks livid like those in death. I was overcome by gloom\n",
      "and misery and often reflected I had better seek death than desire to\n",
      "remain in a world which to me was replete with wretchedness. At one time I\n",
      "considered whether I should not declare myself guilty and suffer the\n",
      "penalty of the law, less innocent than poor Justine had been. Such were my\n",
      "thoughts when the door of my apartment was opened and Mr. Kirwin entered.\n",
      "His countenance expressed sympathy and compassion; he drew a chair close to\n",
      "mine and addressed me in French,\n",
      "\n",
      "“I fear that this place is very shocking to you; can I do anything to\n",
      "make you more comfortable?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I thank you, but all that you mention is nothing to me; on the whole\n",
      "earth there is no comfort which I am capable of receiving.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I know that the sympathy of a stranger can be but of little relief to\n",
      "one borne down as you are by so strange a misfortune.  But you will, I\n",
      "hope, soon quit this melancholy abode, for doubtless evidence can\n",
      "easily be brought to free you from the criminal charge.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“That is my least concern; I am, by a course of strange events, become\n",
      "the most miserable of mortals.  Persecuted and tortured as I am and\n",
      "have been, can death be any evil to me?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nothing indeed could be more unfortunate and agonising than the\n",
      "strange chances that have lately occurred.  You were thrown, by some\n",
      "surprising accident, on this shore, renowned for its hospitality,\n",
      "seized immediately, and charged with murder.  The first sight that was\n",
      "presented to your eyes was the body of your friend, murdered in so\n",
      "unaccountable a manner and placed, as it were, by some fiend across\n",
      "your path.”\n",
      "\n",
      "As Mr. Kirwin said this, notwithstanding the agitation I endured on\n",
      "this retrospect of my sufferings, I also felt considerable surprise at\n",
      "the knowledge he seemed to possess concerning me.  I suppose some\n",
      "astonishment was exhibited in my countenance, for Mr. Kirwin hastened\n",
      "to say,\n",
      "\n",
      "“Immediately upon your being taken ill, all the papers that were on\n",
      "your person were brought me, and I examined them that I might discover some\n",
      "trace by which I could send to your relations an account of your misfortune\n",
      "and illness. I found several letters, and, among others, one which I\n",
      "discovered from its commencement to be from your father. I instantly wrote\n",
      "to Geneva; nearly two months have elapsed since the departure of my letter.\n",
      "But you are ill; even now you tremble; you are unfit for agitation of any\n",
      "kind.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“This suspense is a thousand times worse than the most horrible event;\n",
      "tell me what new scene of death has been acted, and whose murder I am\n",
      "now to lament?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Your family is perfectly well,” said Mr. Kirwin with\n",
      "gentleness; “and someone, a friend, is come to visit you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "I know not by what chain of thought the idea presented itself, but it\n",
      "instantly darted into my mind that the murderer had come to mock at my\n",
      "misery and taunt me with the death of Clerval, as a new incitement for\n",
      "me to comply with his hellish desires.  I put my hand before my eyes,\n",
      "and cried out in agony,\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh! Take him away! I cannot see him; for God’s sake, do not\n",
      "let him enter!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Kirwin regarded me with a troubled countenance.  He could not help\n",
      "regarding my exclamation as a presumption of my guilt and said in\n",
      "rather a severe tone,\n",
      "\n",
      "“I should have thought, young man, that the presence of your father\n",
      "would have been welcome instead of inspiring such violent repugnance.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“My father!” cried I, while every feature and every muscle was relaxed\n",
      "from anguish to pleasure.  “Is my father indeed come?  How kind, how\n",
      "very kind!  But where is he, why does he not hasten to me?”\n",

      "of nightmare; I felt the fiend’s grasp in my neck and could not free\n",
      "myself from it; groans and cries rang in my ears. My father, who was\n",

      "small but bound close by the ties of affection and mutual misfortune.\n",
      "And when time shall have softened your despair, new and dear objects of\n",

      "deprived.”\n",

      "Such were the lessons of my father.  But to me the remembrance of the\n",
      "threat returned; nor can you wonder that, omnipotent as the fiend had\n",
      "yet been in his deeds of blood, I should almost regard him as\n",
      "invincible, and that when he had pronounced the words “_I shall be with\n",
      "you on your wedding-night_,” I should regard the threatened fate as\n",
      "unavoidable.  But death was no evil to me if the loss of Elizabeth were\n",
      "balanced with it, and I therefore, with a contented and even cheerful\n",
      "countenance, agreed with my father that if my cousin would consent, the\n",
      "ceremony should take place in ten days, and thus put, as I imagined,\n",

      "for ever from my native country and wandered a friendless outcast over\n",
      "the earth than have consented to this miserable marriage.  But, as if\n",
      "possessed of magic powers, the monster had blinded me to his real\n",
      "intentions; and when I thought that I had prepared only my own death, I\n",
      "hastened that of a far dearer victim.\n",
      "\n",
      "As the period fixed for our marriage drew nearer, whether from cowardice or\n",
      "a prophetic feeling, I felt my heart sink within me. But I concealed my\n",
      "feelings by an appearance of hilarity that brought smiles and joy to the\n",
      "countenance of my father, but hardly deceived the ever-watchful and nicer\n",
      "eye of Elizabeth. She looked forward to our union with placid contentment,\n",
      "not unmingled with a little fear, which past misfortunes had impressed,\n",
      "that what now appeared certain and tangible happiness might soon dissipate\n",
      "into an airy dream and leave no trace but deep and everlasting regret.\n",
      "\n",
      "Preparations were made for the event, congratulatory visits were received,\n",
      "and all wore a smiling appearance. I shut up, as well as I could, in my own\n",
      "heart the anxiety that preyed there and entered with seeming earnestness\n",
      "into the plans of my father, although they might only serve as the\n",
      "decorations of my tragedy. Through my father’s exertions a part of\n",
      "the inheritance of Elizabeth had been restored to her by the Austrian\n",
      "government. A small possession on the shores of Como belonged to her. It\n",
      "was agreed that, immediately after our union, we should proceed to Villa\n",
      "Lavenza and spend our first days of happiness beside the beautiful lake\n",
      "near which it stood.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the meantime I took every precaution to defend my person in case the\n",
      "fiend should openly attack me.  I carried pistols and a dagger\n",
      "constantly about me and was ever on the watch to prevent artifice, and\n",
      "by these means gained a greater degree of tranquillity.  Indeed, as the\n",
      "period approached, the threat appeared more as a delusion, not to be\n",
      "regarded as worthy to disturb my peace, while the happiness I hoped for\n",
      "in my marriage wore a greater appearance of certainty as the day fixed\n",
      "for its solemnisation drew nearer and I heard it continually spoken of\n",
      "as an occurrence which no accident could possibly prevent.\n",
      "\n",
      "Elizabeth seemed happy; my tranquil demeanour contributed greatly to\n",
      "calm her mind.  But on the day that was to fulfil my wishes and my\n",
      "destiny, she was melancholy, and a presentiment of evil pervaded her;\n",
      "and perhaps also she thought of the dreadful secret which I had\n",
      "promised to reveal to her on the following day.  My father was in the\n",
      "meantime overjoyed, and, in the bustle of preparation, only recognised in\n",

      "\n",
      "After the ceremony was performed a large party assembled at my\n",
      "father’s, but it was agreed that Elizabeth and I should commence our\n",
      "journey by water, sleeping that night at Evian and continuing our\n",
      "voyage on the following day.  The day was fair, the wind favourable;\n",
      "all smiled on our nuptial embarkation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Those were the last moments of my life during which I enjoyed the\n",
      "feeling of happiness.  We passed rapidly along; the sun was hot, but we\n",
      "were sheltered from its rays by a kind of canopy while we enjoyed the\n",
      "beauty of the scene, sometimes on one side of the lake, where we saw\n",
      "Mont Salêve, the pleasant banks of Montalègre, and at a distance,\n",
      "surmounting all, the beautiful Mont Blanc, and the assemblage of snowy\n",
      "mountains that in vain endeavour to emulate her; sometimes coasting the\n",
      "opposite banks, we saw the mighty Jura opposing its dark side to the\n",
      "ambition that would quit its native country, and an almost\n",
      "insurmountable barrier to the invader who should wish to enslave it.\n",
      "\n",
      "I took the hand of Elizabeth.  “You are sorrowful, my love.  Ah!  If\n",
      "you knew what I have suffered and what I may yet endure, you would\n",
      "endeavour to let me taste the quiet and freedom from despair that this\n",
      "one day at least permits me to enjoy.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Be happy, my dear Victor,” replied Elizabeth; “there is, I hope,\n",
      "nothing to distress you; and be assured that if a lively joy is not\n",
      "painted in my face, my heart is contented.  Something whispers to me\n",
      "not to depend too much on the prospect that is opened before us, but I\n",
      "will not listen to such a sinister voice.  Observe how fast we move\n",
      "along and how the clouds, which sometimes obscure and sometimes rise\n",
      "above the dome of Mont Blanc, render this scene of beauty still more\n",
      "interesting.  Look also at the innumerable fish that are swimming in\n",
      "the clear waters, where we can distinguish every pebble that lies at\n",
      "the bottom.  What a divine day!  How happy and serene all nature\n",
      "appears!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus Elizabeth endeavoured to divert her thoughts and mine from all\n",

      "joy for a few instants shone in her eyes, but it continually gave place\n",
      "to distraction and reverie.\n",
      "\n",
      "The sun sank lower in the heavens; we passed the river Drance and\n",
      "observed its path through the chasms of the higher and the glens of the\n",
      "lower hills.  The Alps here come closer to the lake, and we approached\n",
      "the amphitheatre of mountains which forms its eastern boundary.  The\n",
      "spire of Evian shone under the woods that surrounded it and the range\n",
      "of mountain above mountain by which it was overhung.\n",
      "\n",
      "The wind, which had hitherto carried us along with amazing rapidity,\n",
      "sank at sunset to a light breeze; the soft air just ruffled the water\n",
      "and caused a pleasant motion among the trees as we approached the\n",
      "shore, from which it wafted the most delightful scent of flowers and\n",
      "hay.  The sun sank beneath the horizon as we landed, and as I touched\n",

      "The wind, which had fallen in the south, now rose with great violence\n",

      "\n",
      "I had been calm during the day, but so soon as night obscured the\n",

      "and watchful, while my right hand grasped a pistol which was hidden in\n",
      "my bosom; every sound terrified me, but I resolved that I would sell my\n",
      "life dearly and not shrink from the conflict until my own life or that\n",
      "of my adversary was extinguished.\n",
      "\n",
      "Elizabeth observed my agitation for some time in timid and fearful silence,\n",
      "but there was something in my glance which communicated terror to her, and\n",
      "trembling, she asked, “What is it that agitates you, my dear Victor?\n",

      "until I had obtained some knowledge as to the situation of my enemy.\n",
      "\n",
      "She left me, and I continued some time walking up and down the passages\n",
      "of the house and inspecting every corner that might afford a retreat to\n",
      "my adversary.  But I discovered no trace of him and was beginning to\n",
      "conjecture that some fortunate chance had intervened to prevent the\n",
      "execution of his menaces when suddenly I heard a shrill and dreadful\n",
      "scream.  It came from the room into which Elizabeth had retired.  As I\n",
      "heard it, the whole truth rushed into my mind, my arms dropped, the\n",
      "motion of every muscle and fibre was suspended; I could feel the blood\n",
      "trickling in my veins and tingling in the extremities of my limbs. This\n",
      "state lasted but for an instant; the scream was repeated, and I rushed\n",
      "into the room.\n",
      "\n",
      "Great God! Why did I not then expire! Why am I here to relate the\n",
      "destruction of the best hope and the purest creature on earth? She was\n",
      "there, lifeless and inanimate, thrown across the bed, her head hanging down\n",
      "and her pale and distorted features half covered by her hair. Everywhere I\n",
      "turn I see the same figure—her bloodless arms and relaxed form flung\n",
      "by the murderer on its bridal bier. Could I behold this and live? Alas!\n",
      "Life is obstinate and clings closest where it is most hated. For a moment\n",
      "only did I lose recollection; I fell senseless on the ground.\n",
      "\n",
      "When I recovered I found myself surrounded by the people of the inn; their\n",
      "countenances expressed a breathless terror, but the horror of others\n",
      "appeared only as a mockery, a shadow of the feelings that oppressed me. I\n",
      "escaped from them to the room where lay the body of Elizabeth, my love, my\n",
      "wife, so lately living, so dear, so worthy. She had been moved from the\n",
      "posture in which I had first beheld her, and now, as she lay, her head upon\n",
      "her arm and a handkerchief thrown across her face and neck, I might have\n",
      "supposed her asleep. I rushed towards her and embraced her with ardour, but\n",
      "the deadly languor and coldness of the limbs told me that what I now held\n",
      "in my arms had ceased to be the Elizabeth whom I had loved and cherished.\n",
      "The murderous mark of the fiend’s grasp was on her neck, and the\n",
      "breath had ceased to issue from her lips.\n",
      "\n",
      "While I still hung over her in the agony of despair, I happened to look up.\n",
      "The windows of the room had before been darkened, and I felt a kind of\n",
      "panic on seeing the pale yellow light of the moon illuminate the chamber.\n",
      "The shutters had been thrown back, and with a sensation of horror not to be\n",
      "described, I saw at the open window a figure the most hideous and abhorred.\n",
      "A grin was on the face of the monster; he seemed to jeer, as with his\n",
      "fiendish finger he pointed towards the corpse of my wife. I rushed towards\n",
      "the window, and drawing a pistol from my bosom, fired; but he eluded me,\n",
      "leaped from his station, and running with the swiftness of lightning,\n",
      "plunged into the lake.\n",
      "\n",
      "The report of the pistol brought a crowd into the room. I pointed to\n",
      "the spot where he had disappeared, and we followed the track with\n",
      "boats; nets were cast, but in vain.  After passing several hours, we\n",
      "returned hopeless, most of my companions believing it to have been a\n",
      "form conjured up by my fancy.  After having landed, they proceeded to\n",
      "search the country, parties going in different directions among the\n",
      "woods and vines.\n",
      "\n",
      "I attempted to accompany them and proceeded a short distance from the\n",
      "house, but my head whirled round, my steps were like those of a drunken\n",
      "man, I fell at last in a state of utter exhaustion; a film covered my\n",
      "eyes, and my skin was parched with the heat of fever.  In this state I\n",
      "was carried back and placed on a bed, hardly conscious of what had\n",
      "happened; my eyes wandered round the room as if to seek something that\n",
      "I had lost.\n",
      "\n",
      "After an interval I arose, and as if by instinct, crawled into the room\n",
      "where the corpse of my beloved lay.  There were women weeping around; I\n",
      "hung over it and joined my sad tears to theirs; all this time no\n",
      "distinct idea presented itself to my mind, but my thoughts rambled to\n",
      "various subjects, reflecting confusedly on my misfortunes and their\n",
      "cause.  I was bewildered, in a cloud of wonder and horror.  The death\n",
      "of William, the execution of Justine, the murder of Clerval, and lastly\n",
      "of my wife; even at that moment I knew not that my only remaining\n",
      "friends were safe from the malignity of the fiend; my father even now\n",
      "might be writhing under his grasp, and Ernest might be dead at his\n",
      "feet.  This idea made me shudder and recalled me to action.  I started\n",
      "up and resolved to return to Geneva with all possible speed.\n",
      "\n",
      "There were no horses to be procured, and I must return by the lake; but the\n",
      "wind was unfavourable, and the rain fell in torrents. However, it was\n",
      "hardly morning, and I might reasonably hope to arrive by night. I hired men\n",
      "to row and took an oar myself, for I had always experienced relief from\n",
      "mental torment in bodily exercise. But the overflowing misery I now felt,\n",
      "and the excess of agitation that I endured rendered me incapable of any\n",
      "exertion. I threw down the oar, and leaning my head upon my hands, gave way\n",
      "to every gloomy idea that arose. If I looked up, I saw scenes which were\n",
      "familiar to me in my happier time and which I had contemplated but the day\n",
      "before in the company of her who was now but a shadow and a recollection.\n",
      "Tears streamed from my eyes. The rain had ceased for a moment, and I saw\n",
      "the fish play in the waters as they had done a few hours before; they had\n",
      "then been observed by Elizabeth. Nothing is so painful to the human mind as\n",
      "a great and sudden change. The sun might shine or the clouds might lower,\n",
      "but nothing could appear to me as it had done the day before. A fiend had\n",
      "snatched from me every hope of future happiness; no creature had ever been\n",
      "so miserable as I was; so frightful an event is single in the history of\n",
      "man.\n",
      "\n",
      "But why should I dwell upon the incidents that followed this last\n",
      "overwhelming event? Mine has been a tale of horrors; I have reached their\n",
      "_acme_, and what I must now relate can but be tedious to you. Know\n",
      "that, one by one, my friends were snatched away; I was left desolate. My\n",
      "own strength is exhausted, and I must tell, in a few words, what remains of\n",
      "my hideous narration.\n",
      "\n",
      "I arrived at Geneva. My father and Ernest yet lived, but the former sunk\n",
      "under the tidings that I bore. I see him now, excellent and venerable old\n",
      "man! His eyes wandered in vacancy, for they had lost their charm and their\n",
      "delight—his Elizabeth, his more than daughter, whom he doted on with\n",
      "all that affection which a man feels, who in the decline of life, having\n",
      "few affections, clings more earnestly to those that remain. Cursed, cursed\n",
      "be the fiend that brought misery on his grey hairs and doomed him to waste\n",
      "in wretchedness! He could not live under the horrors that were accumulated\n",
      "around him; the springs of existence suddenly gave way; he was unable to\n",
      "rise from his bed, and in a few days he died in my arms.\n",
      "\n",
      "What then became of me?  I know not; I lost sensation, and chains and\n",
      "darkness were the only objects that pressed upon me.  Sometimes,\n",
      "indeed, I dreamt that I wandered in flowery meadows and pleasant vales\n",
      "with the friends of my youth, but I awoke and found myself in a\n",
      "dungeon.  Melancholy followed, but by degrees I gained a clear\n",
      "conception of my miseries and situation and was then released from my\n",
      "prison.  For they had called me mad, and during many months, as I\n",
      "understood, a solitary cell had been my habitation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Liberty, however, had been a useless gift to me, had I not, as I\n",
      "awakened to reason, at the same time awakened to revenge.  As the\n",
      "memory of past misfortunes pressed upon me, I began to reflect on their\n",
      "cause—the monster whom I had created, the miserable dæmon whom I had\n",
      "sent abroad into the world for my destruction.  I was possessed by a\n",
      "maddening rage when I thought of him, and desired and ardently prayed\n",
      "that I might have him within my grasp to wreak a great and signal\n",
      "revenge on his cursed head.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nor did my hate long confine itself to useless wishes; I began to\n",
      "reflect on the best means of securing him; and for this purpose, about\n",
      "a month after my release, I repaired to a criminal judge in the town\n",
      "and told him that I had an accusation to make, that I knew the\n",
      "destroyer of my family, and that I required him to exert his whole\n",
      "authority for the apprehension of the murderer.\n",
      "\n",
      "The magistrate listened to me with attention and kindness. “Be\n",
      "assured, sir,” said he, “no pains or exertions on my part shall\n",
      "be spared to discover the villain.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I thank you,” replied I; “listen, therefore, to the\n",
      "deposition that I have to make. It is indeed a tale so strange that I\n",
      "should fear you would not credit it were there not something in truth\n",
      "which, however wonderful, forces conviction. The story is too connected to\n",
      "be mistaken for a dream, and I have no motive for falsehood.” My\n",
      "manner as I thus addressed him was impressive but calm; I had formed in my\n",
      "own heart a resolution to pursue my destroyer to death, and this purpose\n",
      "quieted my agony and for an interval reconciled me to life. I now related\n",
      "my history briefly but with firmness and precision, marking the dates with\n",
      "accuracy and never deviating into invective or exclamation.\n",
      "\n",
      "The magistrate appeared at first perfectly incredulous, but as I continued\n",
      "he became more attentive and interested; I saw him sometimes shudder with\n",
      "horror; at others a lively surprise, unmingled with disbelief, was painted\n",
      "on his countenance.\n",
      "\n",
      "When I had concluded my narration, I said, “This is the being whom I\n",
      "accuse and for whose seizure and punishment I call upon you to exert your\n",
      "whole power. It is your duty as a magistrate, and I believe and hope that\n",

      "functions on this occasion.”\n",
      "\n",
      "This address caused a considerable change in the physiognomy of my own\n",
      "auditor. He had heard my story with that half kind of belief that is given\n",
      "to a tale of spirits and supernatural events; but when he was called upon\n",
      "to act officially in consequence, the whole tide of his incredulity\n",
      "returned. He, however, answered mildly, “I would willingly afford you\n",
      "every aid in your pursuit, but the creature of whom you speak appears to\n",
      "have powers which would put all my exertions to defiance. Who can follow an\n",
      "animal which can traverse the sea of ice and inhabit caves and dens where\n",
      "no man would venture to intrude? Besides, some months have elapsed since\n",
      "the commission of his crimes, and no one can conjecture to what place he\n",
      "has wandered or what region he may now inhabit.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I do not doubt that he hovers near the spot which I inhabit, and if\n",
      "he has indeed taken refuge in the Alps, he may be hunted like the chamois\n",
      "and destroyed as a beast of prey. But I perceive your thoughts; you do not\n",
      "credit my narrative and do not intend to pursue my enemy with the\n",
      "punishment which is his desert.”\n",
      "\n",
      "As I spoke, rage sparkled in my eyes; the magistrate was intimidated.\n",
      "“You are mistaken,” said he. “I will exert myself, and if\n",
      "it is in my power to seize the monster, be assured that he shall suffer\n",
      "punishment proportionate to his crimes. But I fear, from what you have\n",
      "yourself described to be his properties, that this will prove\n",
      "impracticable; and thus, while every proper measure is pursued, you should\n",
      "make up your mind to disappointment.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“That cannot be; but all that I can say will be of little avail.  My\n",
      "revenge is of no moment to you; yet, while I allow it to be a vice, I\n",
      "confess that it is the devouring and only passion of my soul.  My rage\n",
      "is unspeakable when I reflect that the murderer, whom I have turned\n",
      "loose upon society, still exists.  You refuse my just demand; I have\n",
      "but one resource, and I devote myself, either in my life or death, to\n",
      "his destruction.”\n",
      "\n",
      "I trembled with excess of agitation as I said this; there was a frenzy\n",

      "My present situation was one in which all voluntary thought was\n",

      "endowed me with strength and composure; it moulded my feelings and\n",

      "what path I should pursue.  As night approached I found myself at the\n",
      "entrance of the cemetery where William, Elizabeth, and my father\n",
      "reposed.  I entered it and approached the tomb which marked their\n",

      "and kissed the earth and with quivering lips exclaimed, “By the\n",

      "deep and eternal grief that I feel, I swear; and by thee, O Night, and the\n",

      "mortal speed.\n",
      "\n",
      "I pursued him, and for many months this has been my task.  Guided by a\n",

      "blue Mediterranean appeared, and by a strange chance, I saw the fiend\n",
      "enter by night and hide himself in a vessel bound for the Black Sea.  I\n",
      "took my passage in the same ship, but he escaped, I know not how.\n",
      "\n",
      "Amidst the wilds of Tartary and Russia, although he still evaded me, I\n",
      "have ever followed in his track.  Sometimes the peasants, scared by\n",
      "this horrid apparition, informed me of his path; sometimes he himself,\n",
      "who feared that if I lost all trace of him I should despair and die,\n",
      "left some mark to guide me.  The snows descended on my head, and I saw\n",
      "the print of his huge step on the white plain.  To you first entering\n",
      "on life, to whom care is new and agony unknown, how can you understand\n",
      "what I have felt and still feel?  Cold, want, and fatigue were the\n",
      "least pains which I was destined to endure; I was cursed by some devil\n",
      "and carried about with me my eternal hell; yet still a spirit of good\n",
      "followed and directed my steps and when I most murmured would suddenly\n",
      "extricate me from seemingly insurmountable difficulties.  Sometimes,\n",
      "when nature, overcome by hunger, sank under the exhaustion, a repast\n",
      "was prepared for me in the desert that restored and inspirited me.  The\n",
      "fare was, indeed, coarse, such as the peasants of the country ate, but\n",
      "I will not doubt that it was set there by the spirits that I had\n",
      "invoked to aid me.  Often, when all was dry, the heavens cloudless, and\n",
      "I was parched by thirst, a slight cloud would bedim the sky, shed the\n",
      "few drops that revived me, and vanish.\n",
      "\n",
      "I followed, when I could, the courses of the rivers; but the dæmon\n",
      "generally avoided these, as it was here that the population of the\n",
      "country chiefly collected.  In other places human beings were seldom\n",
      "seen, and I generally subsisted on the wild animals that crossed my\n",
      "path.  I had money with me and gained the friendship of the villagers\n",
      "by distributing it; or I brought with me some food that I had killed,\n",
      "which, after taking a small part, I always presented to those who had\n",
      "provided me with fire and utensils for cooking.\n",
      "\n",
      "My life, as it passed thus, was indeed hateful to me, and it was during\n",
      "sleep alone that I could taste joy. O blessed sleep! Often, when most\n",
      "miserable, I sank to repose, and my dreams lulled me even to rapture. The\n",
      "spirits that guarded me had provided these moments, or rather hours, of\n",
      "happiness that I might retain strength to fulfil my pilgrimage. Deprived of\n",
      "this respite, I should have sunk under my hardships. During the day I was\n",
      "sustained and inspirited by the hope of night, for in sleep I saw my\n",
      "friends, my wife, and my beloved country; again I saw the benevolent\n",
      "countenance of my father, heard the silver tones of my Elizabeth’s\n",
      "voice, and beheld Clerval enjoying health and youth. Often, when wearied by\n",
      "a toilsome march, I persuaded myself that I was dreaming until night should\n",
      "come and that I should then enjoy reality in the arms of my dearest\n",
      "friends. What agonising fondness did I feel for them! How did I cling to\n",
      "their dear forms, as sometimes they haunted even my waking hours, and\n",
      "persuade myself that they still lived! At such moments vengeance, that\n",
      "burned within me, died in my heart, and I pursued my path towards the\n",
      "destruction of the dæmon more as a task enjoined by heaven, as the\n",
      "mechanical impulse of some power of which I was unconscious, than as the\n",
      "ardent desire of my soul.\n",

      "What his feelings were whom I pursued I cannot know. Sometimes, indeed, he\n",
      "left marks in writing on the barks of the trees or cut in stone that guided\n",
      "me and instigated my fury. “My reign is not yet\n",
      "over”—these words were legible in one of these\n",

      "\n",

      "reward of my tedious toil and horrible pilgrimage!\n",
      "\n",
      "As I still pursued my journey to the northward, the snows thickened and the\n",
      "cold increased in a degree almost too severe to support. The peasants were\n",
      "shut up in their hovels, and only a few of the most hardy ventured forth to\n",
      "seize the animals whom starvation had forced from their hiding-places to\n",
      "seek for prey. The rivers were covered with ice, and no fish could be\n",
      "procured; and thus I was cut off from my chief article of maintenance.\n",

      "upon a journey where your sufferings will satisfy my everlasting\n",
      "hatred.”\n",

      "My courage and perseverance were invigorated by these scoffing words; I\n",
      "resolved not to fail in my purpose, and calling on Heaven to support\n",
      "me, I continued with unabated fervour to traverse immense deserts,\n",
      "until the ocean appeared at a distance and formed the utmost boundary\n",
      "of the horizon.  Oh!  How unlike it was to the blue seasons of the\n",
      "south!  Covered with ice, it was only to be distinguished from land by\n",
      "its superior wildness and ruggedness.  The Greeks wept for joy when\n",
      "they beheld the Mediterranean from the hills of Asia, and hailed with\n",
      "rapture the boundary of their toils.  I did not weep, but I knelt down\n",
      "and with a full heart thanked my guiding spirit for conducting me in\n",

      "Some weeks before this period I had procured a sledge and dogs and thus\n",
      "traversed the snows with inconceivable speed.  I know not whether the\n",
      "fiend possessed the same advantages, but I found that, as before I had\n",
      "daily lost ground in the pursuit, I now gained on him, so much so that\n",
      "when I first saw the ocean he was but one day’s journey in advance, and\n",
      "I hoped to intercept him before he should reach the beach.  With new\n",
      "courage, therefore, I pressed on, and in two days arrived at a wretched\n",
      "hamlet on the seashore.  I inquired of the inhabitants concerning the\n",
      "fiend and gained accurate information.  A gigantic monster, they said,\n",
      "had arrived the night before, armed with a gun and many pistols,\n",
      "putting to flight the inhabitants of a solitary cottage through fear of\n",
      "his terrific appearance.  He had carried off their store of winter\n",
      "food, and placing it in a sledge, to draw which he had seized on a\n",
      "numerous drove of trained dogs, he had harnessed them, and the same\n",
      "night, to the joy of the horror-struck villagers, had pursued his\n",
      "journey across the sea in a direction that led to no land; and they\n",
      "conjectured that he must speedily be destroyed by the breaking of the\n",
      "ice or frozen by the eternal  frosts.\n",
      "\n",
      "On hearing this information I suffered a temporary access of despair.\n",
      "He had escaped me, and I must commence a destructive and almost endless\n",
      "journey across the mountainous ices of the ocean, amidst cold that few\n",
      "of the inhabitants could long endure and which I, the native of a\n",
      "genial and sunny climate, could not hope to survive.  Yet at the idea\n",
      "that the fiend should live and be triumphant, my rage and vengeance\n",
      "returned, and like a mighty tide, overwhelmed every other feeling.\n",
      "After a slight repose, during which the spirits of the dead hovered\n",
      "round and instigated me to toil and revenge, I prepared for my journey.\n",
      "\n",
      "I exchanged my land-sledge for one fashioned for the inequalities of\n",
      "the Frozen Ocean, and purchasing a plentiful stock of provisions, I\n",
      "departed from land.\n",
      "\n",
      "I cannot guess how many days have passed since then, but I have endured\n",
      "misery which nothing but the eternal sentiment of a just retribution\n",
      "burning within my heart could have enabled me to support.  Immense and\n",
      "rugged mountains of ice often barred up my passage, and I often heard\n",
      "the thunder of the ground sea, which threatened my destruction.  But\n",
      "again the frost came and made the paths of the sea secure.\n",
      "\n",
      "By the quantity of provision which I had consumed, I should guess that\n",
      "I had passed three weeks in this journey; and the continual protraction\n",
      "of hope, returning back upon the heart, often wrung bitter drops of\n",
      "despondency and grief from my eyes.  Despair had indeed almost secured\n",
      "her prey, and I should soon have sunk beneath this misery.  Once, after\n",
      "the poor animals that conveyed me had with incredible toil gained the\n",
      "summit of a sloping ice mountain, and one, sinking under his fatigue,\n",
      "died, I viewed the expanse before me with anguish, when suddenly my eye\n",
      "caught a dark speck upon the dusky plain.  I strained my sight to\n",
      "discover what it could be and uttered a wild cry of ecstasy when I\n",
      "distinguished a sledge and the distorted proportions of a well-known\n",
      "form within.  Oh!  With what a burning gush did hope revisit my heart!\n",
      "Warm tears filled my eyes, which I hastily wiped away, that they might\n",
      "not intercept the view I had of the dæmon; but still my sight was\n",
      "dimmed by the burning drops, until, giving way to the emotions that\n",
      "oppressed me, I wept aloud.\n",
      "\n",
      "But this was not the time for delay; I disencumbered the dogs of their\n",
      "dead companion, gave them a plentiful portion of food, and after an\n",
      "hour’s rest, which was absolutely necessary, and yet which was bitterly\n",
      "irksome to me, I continued my route.  The sledge was still visible, nor\n",
      "did I again lose sight of it except at the moments when for a short\n",
      "time some ice-rock concealed it with its intervening crags.  I indeed\n",
      "perceptibly gained on it, and when, after nearly two days’ journey, I\n",
      "beheld my enemy at no more than a mile distant, my heart bounded within\n",
      "me.\n",
      "\n",
      "But now, when I appeared almost within grasp of my foe, my hopes were\n",
      "suddenly extinguished, and I lost all trace of him more utterly than I had\n",
      "ever done before. A ground sea was heard; the thunder of its progress, as\n",
      "the waters rolled and swelled beneath me, became every moment more ominous\n",
      "and terrific. I pressed on, but in vain. The wind arose; the sea roared;\n",
      "and, as with the mighty shock of an earthquake, it split and cracked with a\n",
      "tremendous and overwhelming sound. The work was soon finished; in a few\n",
      "minutes a tumultuous sea rolled between me and my enemy, and I was left\n",
      "drifting on a scattered piece of ice that was continually lessening and\n",
      "thus preparing for me a hideous death.\n",
      "\n",
      "In this manner many appalling hours passed; several of my dogs died, and I\n",
      "myself was about to sink under the accumulation of distress when I saw your\n",
      "vessel riding at anchor and holding forth to me hopes of succour and life.\n",
      "I had no conception that vessels ever came so far north and was astounded\n",
      "at the sight. I quickly destroyed part of my sledge to construct oars, and\n",
      "by these means was enabled, with infinite fatigue, to move my ice raft in\n",
      "the direction of your ship. I had determined, if you were going southwards,\n",
      "still to trust myself to the mercy of the seas rather than abandon my\n",
      "purpose. I hoped to induce you to grant me a boat with which I could pursue\n",
      "my enemy. But your direction was northwards. You took me on board when my\n",

      "the worth of my nature supported me when others would have been oppressed,\n",

      "this thought, which supported me in the commencement of my career, now\n",

      "face, there was something so scaring and unearthly in his ugliness. I\n",
      "attempted to speak, but the words died away on my lips. The monster\n",

      "susceptible of love and sympathy, and when wrenched by misery to vice\n",
